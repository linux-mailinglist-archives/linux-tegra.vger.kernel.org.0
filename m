I'm nowhere near as familiar with T114 as T124, so I can't be 100% sure. 
However, a very quick look at the CAR section in the T114 TRM does show 
the same gate/mux structure around a reshift and fuse clock, so I assume 
the requirement is identical there.

Also, NVIDIA's downstream kernel has a compile-time ifdef around the 
code I've added here. It's not compiled for T30 specifically, and is 
compiled for anything else, which I believe means both T114 and T124.

In patch 1 in this series, I only enabled the fuse clock for T124, since 
I don't have a T114 system to test any more. However, the revised patch 
1 that Thierry and I are discussing would enable the fuse clock on all 
SoCs, and hence make the code work identically on T114 as it does on T124.
