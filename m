Nicolin, thank you very much for the help!

We still have issues in the DRM and other drivers that don't allow us to
flip ON the IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA support.

My patch addresses the issue with the ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU option, which
allocates the unmanaged domain for DMA purposes on ARM32, causing the
trouble in the multiplatform kernel configuration since it's not
possible to opt-out from ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU in this case. Perhaps this
needs to be clarified in the commit message.
