The !RPM case isn't supported by Tegra anymore in upstream kernel. I'm
trying to help to make yours driver better and gave you reasons to
remove the unneeded code, while you're keep saying that "there is no
harm to retain it", which is not a reason to clutter up the code. I
don't feel that it's worthwhile to continue arguing here.
