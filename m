I am just trying to understand what this patch does. By reading it again
it looks like it makes GPIO PERST# reset mandatory for all platforms
supported by this driver (because if the driver does not grab an handle
to the GPIO tegra_pcie_parse_dt() fails), if I read the code correctly,
apologies if not.

Which makes me question the check:

	if (port->reset_gpiod) {
		gpiod_set_value(port->reset_gpiod, 0);

in tegra_pcie_port_reset(), if we are there port->reset_gpiod can't be
NULL or I am missing something and also make:

	} else {
		value = afi_readl(port->pcie, ctrl);
		value &= ~AFI_PEX_CTRL_RST;
		afi_writel(port->pcie, value, ctrl);
	}

path dead code.

Is this GPIO based #PERST a per-platform requirement or you want
to update the driver to always use GPIO based #PERST ?

And if it is a per-platform requirement I assume that a missing
DT property describing the GPIO #PERST should cause a probe failure,
not a fallback to port registers reset (which may have unintended
consequences).

From the commit log it is not clear what this patch does and for what
reason it does it but it should be, let's define it here and update the
log accordingly for everyone's benefit.
