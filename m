Fixes is just for pointing where the bug or issue originated.  I usually
include it to help you -- the reviewer -- and backporters if they ever
want to use this patch. It is not specific to stable-directed patches.

For stable candidates there is 'Cc: stable' tag (no need for this patch).

The bug is that this driver (and only this driver in the whole
sound/soc/tegra directory) defaults to m, where all other drivers default
to n (as the policy aboud drivers seems to be [1]). This won't affect
oldconfig, allyesconfig nor allmodconfig, but will not be selected now
for clean builds - meaning less work for those not building for Tegra2.

This I can do. Not all such drivers are enabled, though: eg. AHUB driver
is not. Maybe we need bigger refresh of the defconfigs instead?

Yes, this is a cleanup. :-)
