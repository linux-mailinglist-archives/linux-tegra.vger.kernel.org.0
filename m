Hi,
I don't think it worth it.

Even for patch 2/3 about 'seq_printf' --> 'seq_puts' conversion, I'm not 
fully convinced myself that is useful.

Too trivial clean-ups only mess-up 'git blame' for no real added value.

If you want these clean-ups, I can send a patch for it, but checkpatch 
output need sometimes to be ignored on files already in the tree. At 
least, this is my point of view.
