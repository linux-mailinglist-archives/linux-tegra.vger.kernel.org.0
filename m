I don't think that this a very good excuse for not documenting the
blob's structure.

The blob's EMC table contains stuff specific to downstream kernel, hence
it's a not very re-usable downstream software ABI mixed with HW
description that you're bringing into upstream. This is not very
welcomed, although I don't see it as a big problem if you'll state that
all clearly in the commit message with a solid explanation why it is the
best possible option.

Okay. It will be better if the discussion happened publicly, at least I
hope that Rob is involved in it.
