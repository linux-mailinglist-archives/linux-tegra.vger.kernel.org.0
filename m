No, it is definitely this patch. 100% reproducible.

No, the behaviour on top of -next is different to the "for-5.5/arm/dt"
branch, which is what I am saying.

No, there is plenty to be concerned about, with the latest -next we are
getting these WARN splats on boot, which we need to avoid.

No it should not, but it does.

I add some debug prints and on boot with "for-5.5/arm/dt" is dies while
bringing CPU0 online for cpufreq ...

[    2.863369] cpufreq_dt: dt_cpufreq_probe-347
[    2.867917] cpufreq_dt: dt_cpufreq_probe-360
[    2.872195] cpufreq_dt: dt_cpufreq_probe-370
[    2.876509] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2632
[    2.881219] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2636
[    2.885989] cpufreq: trying to register driver cpufreq-dt
[    2.891395] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2651
[    2.896131] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2661
[    2.900839] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2665
[    2.905610] cpufreq: cpufreq_register_driver-2672
[    2.910329] cpu cpu0: cpufreq_add_dev: adding CPU0
[    2.915152] cpufreq: cpufreq_online: bringing CPU0 online

So I think it is best to revert this for now.
