Well, like I said this is somewhat academic because these are all
referencing the IOMMU that by definition still needs to be around
when this code is called, and there's locks in place to ensure
these don't go away. So it's not like these drivers are doing it
wrong, they're just not doing it pedantically right.

I think you misunderstood. Not calling put_device() would be wrong
because that leaks a reference to the SMMU that you can't get back. My
suggestion was rather to keep put_device() here, but add a comment as to
why it's okay to call the put_device() here, even though you keep using
its private data later beyond this point, which typically would be wrong
to do.
