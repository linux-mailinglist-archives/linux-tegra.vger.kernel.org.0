Oh, I see it now - the logic around tegra_bo_mm_evict_something() 
actually depends on being able to map new PTEs over the top of existing 
ones without an unmap :/

The map/unmap overhead that that's trying to avoid could probably be 
reduced quite significantly anyway by converting GART to the new 
map_pages/unmap_pages callbacks.

Thanks,
Robin.
