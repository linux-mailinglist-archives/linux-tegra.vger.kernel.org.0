The only really sensible choice I see is
rate_limit * some_constant_approximated_runtime
and on many systems that may yield >100% of the capacity.
Qais' proposed changes would even remove the theoretical rate_limit cap here.
A lot of complexity for something that is essentially a non-issue in practice
AFAICS...
