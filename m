Is there any specific reason why should there be a check for the state?
In Tegra series, I observe that, by the time execution comes to this point,
prev_state is PCI_D3Hot and in Tegra194 particularly, it is PCI_D0 because the
host controller driver explicitly keeps the downstream devices in PCI_D0 state
as a work around for one of the Tegra194 specific issues. So, I feel the check
for current_state may not be need here(?)
