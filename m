There are a few things to take into consideration.

First, there are 4 tiers of "freeze" callbacks (->prepare, ->freeze,
->freeze_late, ->freeze_noirq), and analogously for "thaw" callbacks,
but you only use one of them.  This may be fine in a particular case,
but you need to ensure that the other tiers are not needed and, in
particular, the _noirq ones need not be involved.  Also ensure that
they don't assume that PM notifiers have run (or that they will run on
the resume side).

Second, if there are dependencies between the devices being frozen and
other devices, they will have to be taken into account.

Also note that kernel threads are generally not affected by
freeze_processes(), but I guess this is not a problem in your use
case.

Thanks!
