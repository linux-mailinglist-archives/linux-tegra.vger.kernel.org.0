I tried a slightly different variant of the kludge by holding the ASID's
enable till the first mapping is created for the display clients and
IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA now works properly (no EMEM errors on boot and etc) and
without a need to change the DC driver.

I also tried to remove the arm_iommu_detach_device() from the VDE driver
and we now have 3 implicit domains in use (DRM, HX, VDE[wasted]) + 1
explicit (VDE) on T30, which works okay for today. So technically we
could support the IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA with a couple small changes right now
or at least revert the hacks that were needed for Nyan.

But in order to enable IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA properly, we will need to do
something about the DMA mappings first in the DRM driver and I also
found that implicit IOMMU somehow doesn't work for host1x driver at all,
so this needs to be fixed too.
