Oh, come on... The issue is a combination of old dt AND the pcie
driver. I can reproduce low emc clock with that. But then you said
t194 on the regression bench was still timing out even with the new
dt. And that's what I cannot reproduce. And then you asked me to test
with pure mainline and a stock/unmodified defconfig. So I did, using
-next and the two open series, but clarified what an unmodified
defconfig meant.

So, I modified the .config to enable the pcie driver as built-in, then
reflashed. Otherwise the same as my previous post. I got the shell
after 11 seconds. And clocks are still as reported before, cpu at min,
emc at 800000000.
