Understood. By reading the code it looked weird that eg a reset failure
was tolerable - I thought an error would be fatal (I don't know what are
the consequences for instance on a subsequent resume) but it looks like
it actually is not, that's the only point I raised.

It could be useful but it is up to you, I will merge the series as-is
or I can add it myself, as you wish.
