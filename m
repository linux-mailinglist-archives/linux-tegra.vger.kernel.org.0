Reformat the description of various properties to make them more
consistent with existing ones. Make use of json-schema's ability to
provide a description for individual list items to make improve the
documentation further.

Changes in v2:
- instead of rewriting it, drop the reg property description in patch 2
- add Reviewed-by: from Rob
