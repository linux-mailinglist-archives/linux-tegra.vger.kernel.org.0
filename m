I am unsure of this answer.
I'd imagine it found something for the header match to succeed on the
backup, even if the GUID itself is invalid?

It does have a valid GPT located at the sector designated by "gpt_sector".
For several years I have been using a patch I ported for mainline
Linux from the early android hacking days.
It essentially overwrites the expected backup sector with the one
designated in the command line.
Both the Tegra20 Motorola Xoom and the Tegra30 Ouya use this method
successfully.

The ugly hack is essentially what the downstream Android kernel implemented.
Ideally we would be able to support TegraPT, but judging by the amount
of code Dmitry's implementation for the Linux kernel took, it would
probably be simpler and easier to maintain the downstream
implementation.
