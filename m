Yes, I only meant that yours suggestion also should be useful here.
Anyways, thank you for the clarification :)

I agree that the Thierry's proposal is good! But it needs some more
thought yet because it's not very applicable to the current devices.

Very nice! Maybe we will have some more food for the discussion by the
time you'll return. Have a good time!
