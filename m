Are you saying that the clock providers for the "root PLLs" and
"system clocks" have OPP tables themselves? If so, would you mind
posting a patch for an updated DT binding for these changes, so it can
be discussed separately?

I admit, if clock consumer drivers could avoid calling
dev_pm_opp_set_rate|opp(), that would be nice. But, as I stated, it's
a fragile path from locking point of view, to call
dev_pm_opp_set_rate|opp() from a clock provider driver. Personally, I
think it's better to avoid it.

More importantly, you also need to convince the clock subsystem
maintainers, that setting an OPP internally from the clock provider
driver is a good idea. As far as I can tell, they have said *no* to
this, since the common clock framework was invented, I believe for
good reasons.

Thanks, that certainly helped me understand better!

I see that you want to add OPP tables to clock provider nodes. As I
said above, an updated DT binding is probably a good idea to discuss
separately.

Okay, to not stall things from moving forward, may I suggest that you
simply drop the call to lockdep_set_class() (and the corresponding
comment) for now.

Then you can continue to post the next parts - and if it turns out
that lockdep_set_class() becomes needed, you can always add it back
then.

Kind regards
