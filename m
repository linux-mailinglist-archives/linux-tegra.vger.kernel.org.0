I did a read on the code. I have put some thoughts and nits inbetween the
diff, but here are more general questions about the patch:

Is there a reason why the bandwidth is allocated per plane instead of just
using one peak and average for the whole configuration? Or is there a need
to expose all the planes as interconnect channels and allocate their
bandwidth individually?

From algorithmic part I see that the plane overlaps are calculated twice
(A vs B and later B vs A). The cursor plane is ignored, but nevertheless
its overlap mask is calculated before being thrown away. The bandwidths
are also calculated twice: once for pre-commit and then again for
post-commit.  Is setting bandwidth for an interconnect expensive when
re-setting a value that was already set? The code seems to avoid this
case, but maybe unnecessarily?

This looks more like bool in the code using it.

The function's body looks more like 'update' or 'recalculate' rather
than 'check' the memory bandwidth.

Nit: you could declare the bpp_plane here.

Does it really need more bandwidth to scale down? Does it read the same
data multiple times just to throw it away?

I would guess that (src_w * bpp / 8) needs rounding up unless the plane
is continuous. Or you could just add the max rounding error here and
get a safe overestimated value. Maybe this would be better done when
summing per-plane widths.

This could be merged with the assignments after the following 'if' block.

Is plane->index guaranteed to be <= 6? I would guess so, but maybe
BUILD_BUG_ON(sizeof(icc_names)==TEGRA_DC_LEGACY_PLANES_NUM) or some
other check could document this?
