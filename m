To try to move a resolution along, let me try to enumerate the issues
again. Again, please clarify should I have something incorrect or
incomplete.

1) The primary issue is when an old dtb is used with this commit and
the pcie driver is loaded. I can reproduce this issue on t186 and
t194. If this becomes the sole remaining blocking issue, I would like
for an exception to the normal rule be considered and this merged
anyways. Since it does not cause a boot failure and distros package a
new dt normally anyways. And to my knowledge, working around this
would involve redoing part off the icc subsystem itself, a major task
in comparison.

2) T194 is reported to have low clocks even with a new dt on the
Nvidia regression bench. I cannot reproduce this, even with the pcie
driver loaded. Can this be re-verified, please? And if it still
happens, can logs from the failure be made available and/or more
information provided as to the state of the unit? Like changes to the
default defconfig, modules that get loaded, etc.

3) Setting the max clock via debugfs fails when icc has pushed the
current clock higher than the requested rate. This is a logic issue
with all tegra emc drivers that implement dfs via icc. The suggested
resolutions are to leave this as is to keep consistency with the
existing drivers, perhaps updating all later, or to update the
existing implementations in a separate series, then send a new
revision here to match. I am personally unable to verify anything
older than tegra124, however.
