Yes, that would've been my fault. It seemed like the right thing to do
at the time, but the way you describe it makes it obvious that it was
not. I can't say I understand why this would've worked prior to the
rework that made this surface, though.

Yeah, it sounds like this needs to go in ideally before the rework that
caused this to surface in order to preserve bisectibility. But if it
goes in afterwards that's probably fine as well.

Let Jon and myself do a bit of testing with this to verify that the wake
up paths are still working.
