I think I now remember exactly why the "hack" in tegra_smmu_probe()
exists. The reason is that the MC driver does this:

	mc->smmu =3D tegra_smmu_probe(...);

That means that mc->smmu is going to be NULL until tegra_smmu_probe()
has finished. But tegra_smmu_probe() calls bus_set_iommu() and that in
turn calls ->probe_device(). So the purpose of the "hack" in the
tegra_smmu_probe() function was to make sure mc->smmu was available at
that point, because, well, it is already known, but we haven't gotten
around to storing it yet.

->of_xlate() can theoretically be called as early as right after
bus_set_iommu() via of_iommu_configure() if that is called in parallel
with tegra_smmu_probe(). I think that's very unlikely, but I'm not 100%
sure that it can't happen.

In any case, I do agree with Dmitry that we should have a comment here
explaining why this is necessary. Even if we're completely certain that
this is necessary, it's not obvious and therefore should get that
comment. And if we're not certain that it's necessary, it's probably
also good to mention that in the comment so that eventually it can be
determined or the check removed if it proves to be unnecessary.
