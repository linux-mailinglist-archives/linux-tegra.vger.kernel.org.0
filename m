Yeah, it's a very similar patch but I also suggested deleting the
reorder done in the deferred probe code (I'm pretty sure we can drop
it). Here's the thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200625032430.152447-1-saravanak@google.com/

Btw, I've been wondering about this recently. Do we even need
device_pm_move_to_tail() to do the recursive thing once we do "add
device to end of list when added" + "move probed devices to the end
after probe" thing here? Doesn't this guarantee that none of the
consumers can come before the supplier in the dpm list?
