Tegra194 has six PCIe controllers based on Synopsys DesignWare core.
There are two Universal PHY (UPHY) blocks with each supporting 12(HSIO:
Hisg Speed IO) and 8(NVHS: NVIDIA High Speed) lanes respectively.
Controllers:0~4 use UPHY lanes from HSIO brick whereas Controller:5 uses
UPHY lanes from NVHS brick. Lane mapping in HSIO UPHY brick to each PCIe
controller (0~4) is controlled in XBAR module by BPMP-FW. Since PCIe
core has PIPE interface, a glue module called PIPE-to-UPHY (P2U) is used
to connect each UPHY lane (applicable to both HSIO and NVHS UPHY bricks)
to PCIe controller
This patch series
- Adds support for P2U PHY driver
- Adds support for PCIe host controller
- Adds device tree nodes each PCIe controllers
- Enables nodes applicable to p2972-0000 platform
- Adds helper APIs in Designware core driver to get capability regs offset
- Adds defines for new feature registers of PCIe spec revision 4
- Makes changes in DesignWare core driver to get Tegra194 PCIe working

Testing done on P2972-0000 platform
- Able to get PCIe link up with on-board Marvel eSATA controller
- Able to get PCIe link up with NVMe cards connected to M.2 Key-M slot
- Able to do data transfers with both SATA drives and NVMe cards

Note
- Enabling x8 slot on P2972-0000 platform requires pinmux driver for Tegra194.
  It is being worked on currently and hence Controller:5 (i.e. x8 slot) is
  disabled in this patch series. A future patch series would enable this.
- This series is based on top of the following series
  Jisheng's patches to add support to .remove() in Designware sub-system
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=98559
  (Jisheng's patches are now accepted and applied for v5.2)
  My patches made on top of Jisheng's patches to export various symbols
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=101259

Changes since [v8]:
* Made the drivers dependent on ARCH_TEGRA_194_SOC directly
* Addressed review comments from Dmitry

Changes since [v7]:
* Changed P2U driver file name from pcie-p2u-tegra194.c to phy-tegra194-p2u.c
* Addressed review comments from Thierry and Rob

Changes since [v6]:
* Took care of review comments from Rob
* Added a quirk to disable MSI for root ports
* Removed using pcie_pme_disable_msi() API in host controller driver

Changes since [v5]:
* Removed patch that exports pcie_bus_config symbol
* Took care of review comments from Thierry and Rob

Changes since [v4]:
* Removed redundant APIs in pcie-designware-ep.c file after moving them
  to pcie-designware.c file based on Bjorn's review comments

Changes since [v3]:
* Rebased on top of linux-next top of the tree
* Addressed Gustavo's comments and added his Ack for some of the changes.

Changes since [v2]:
* Addressed review comments from Thierry

Changes since [v1]:
* Addressed review comments from Bjorn, Thierry, Jonathan, Rob & Kishon
* Added more patches in v2 series
