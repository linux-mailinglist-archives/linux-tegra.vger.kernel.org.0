It looks to me that the conversion was done properly because rotation
property was added as a common panel property from the start.

I looked through the DT bindings and only those few tiny-DRM drivers use
the DT rotation property. The parsed rotation value passed to the MIPI
DBI core where it's validated and utilized further. I don't feel that
it's worthwhile to touch that code because switching it to the common
DRM helper for reading out DT orientation won't bring any real benefits.

The samsung-s6e8aa0 panel driver indeed uses the non-standard flip-x/y
DT properties in order to achieve the 180 rotation, but I'm not sure
whether it's worthwhile to touch this driver as well because it will
require the board's DT change.

The panel's orientation could be parsed by any panel driver and then
assigned as the connector's property in order to allow userspace/FB-core
to decide what to do with the rotated display. Apparently upstream
kernel supports only that one Samsung device which has display panel
mounted upside-down and it already uses the custom DT properties for
achieving the 180 rotation. So I don't quite see any panel drivers that
instantly could benefit from using the rotation property. Perhaps I can
add the orientation support to the panel-simple driver, but will it be
useful to anyone?
