Hi Mikko, All,

as anticipated, here is another batch of questions that arose after the
(very appreciated!) feedback from Mikko.

Do you think the mainline host1x implementation is 100% compatible with
tegra20? So far I have been assuming that it is, but since my code flow
is now pretty much equal to the old 3.1 driver and I am not receiving
any syncpt events, I started wondering whether the syncpt calls with an
equivalent name really do the same thing or not. Specifically the 
nvhost_syncpt_wait_timeout_ext() in 3.1 looks to have the same
structure as host1x_syncpt_wait() in mainline, but I still haven't dung
into the very details to see if there is any subtle difference.

As I understand it, for my own use case I should never call _incr as it
is what the VI hardware is supposed to do, and rather i should call
_wait to wait for that increment to happen. Coherently, this is what
the 3.1 driver does: it reads the syncpt value into a plain variable,
increments the variable, then calls _wait to wait the syncpt to reach
the same value as the variable.

But the mainline code the the tegra210 VI does many more syncpt calls
and it does not use a variable in the same way. It rather calls
host1x_syncpt_incr() and host1x_syncpt_incr_max() (which it shouldn't
call as you said) but I am not sure these calls achieve the same result.

Do you think the calls that exist in
drivers/staging/media/tegra-video/tegra210.c do make sense for tegra20
too?

About the latest suggestion, which status register are you referring
to? Unfortunately the TRM I have does not document the VIP registers at
all, and the 3.1 driver does not use of them so it's impossible to
infer the bit meanings. Can you suggest any specific register that I
should check?


Another question is about the clocks. I tried to set them up as
similarly as possible to the working 3.1 code, but couldn't have them
identical.

The 3.1 kernel configures this way: 

  pll_c @ 600 MHZ --->     VI @ 150 MHz (/ 4)
  pll_p @ 216 MHZ ---> HOST1X @ 144 MHz (x 2 / 3) 

Mainline does not seem to be able to use a fractional divider for pll_p
to get 144 MHz from 216 MHz (if I ask for 144 i get 108), thus I
currently configured this way:

  pll_c @ 600 MHZ -+->     VI @ 150 MHz (/ 4)
                   `-> HOST1X @ 150 MHz (/ 4)

Do you think there would be any issues in clocking host1x at 150 MHz
instead of 144? 


One last quetion. About the VI configuration, in an attempt to getting
it working with the simplest possible setup I tried using an
interleaved format instead of multiplanar. This results in writing
format 3 instead of 6 in the low bits of
TEGRA_VI_VI_FIRST_OUTPUT_CONTROL. Do you think this may be a problem?


Kind regards,
Luca
