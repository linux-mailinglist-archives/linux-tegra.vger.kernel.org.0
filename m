Reserved regions themselves are software descriptions, no? Then we have 'pool'
flag which is again a software flag and so on. This flag falls into same
category and nothing out of ordinary.

Yes, here are a few examples:
arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-g*.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/at91*.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm7445.dtsi
Then arch/arm/boot/dts/dra7.dtsi is an example where we should map everything
except the reserved region.

It will break compatibility with existing dtbs.

User doesn’t need sram driver in that case. It can use genalloc api directly.
