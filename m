I'm not sure exactly if this would help, but I am working on some
exploratory tweaks to DMA BUF Heaps so that there could be an
in-kernel accessor that returns a struct dma_buf instead of a fd.

This is motivated as some folks want to use DMA BUF Heaps (if I
understand your approach) in a similar fashion, where the driver wants
to generate a DMA BUF but doesn't want to create their own DMA BUF
exporter which would duplicate one of the DMA BUF Heaps.

I'm a little mixed on this as part of the reason DMA BUF Heaps exists
as a userland interface is because its userland which knows the path
that a buffer will take, so userland is in the best position to
understand what type of buffer it needs to allocate. It seems to me
that drivers should instead import a buffer provided to them from
userland to fill, rather than allocating a buffer from a heap they
choose (which may constraint later use of that buffer). But, I also
grant that drivers implementing their own DMA BUF exporters that
duplicate existing code is silly, so having in-kernel allocation
interfaces may be reasonable.

However, the efforts are also somewhat blocked on having a public
in-kernel user of such an interface, so they are basically only
exploratory at the moment. So if you have an in-kernel user interested
in something like this, I'd be glad to get further input.

This probably doesn't help answer your question wrt to GEM, and I'd
defer to Daniel there. :)
