Yes. RAM re-repair wouldn't have been enabled, so in theory any device 
could fail after an LP1 resume, or indeed anything that caused the CPU 
complex rail to be gated.

Yes, that might be a good idea too.

The first two patches in this series are all that's strictly required, 
and the change are pretty small and isolated, so it should be easy to 
back-port.
