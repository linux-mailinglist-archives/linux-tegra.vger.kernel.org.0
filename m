You need to work with a real consumer device and use it everyday to feel
all those problems. But problems always exist, we will fix them
eventually and then have new problems. We also have an alternative
experimental driver that solves the problems for the time being, so it's
not really that bad.

I may sound a bit too negative, but that's because you're are already
doing this work and I want to get your attention to a core problems that
in my opinion should be solved first to avoid a need to re-do the work
later on.

A slow pace parallel work is a normal thing, that's exactly what me and
everyone else are doing in regards to having fun with Tegra development.
We already managed to achieve a lot this way and it's only getting
better every day.

Scheduler is needed for running jobs in a correct order. You don't feel
like it's needed because you use only a single h/w engine and haven't
seen places where it's needed.

DRM scheduler also has a much cleaner code, has more features, it's
optimized, well thought, uses modern upstream concepts and successfully
used by multiple drivers in comparison to what we have in the Host1x driver.

We will discuss it in a more details.
