Is this really true?  I think that would mean CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ would
not find this kind of bug unless we actually registered two or more
handlers for the shared IRQ, but it's still a bug even only one
handler is registered.

Looking at __free_irq() [1], my impression is that "action" is what
we're removing and action->handler() is the IRQ handler we call when
CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, so it doesn't look like it's calling the remaining
handlers after removing one of them.
