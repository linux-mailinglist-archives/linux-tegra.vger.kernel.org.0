Good idea, thanks!  I added this; is it something like what you had in
mind?

    Found by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, which calls the IRQ handler when it
    is being unregistered.  An error during the probe path might cause this
    unregistration and IRQ handler execution before the device or data
    structure init has finished.
