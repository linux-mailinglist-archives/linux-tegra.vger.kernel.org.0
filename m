Hi Bjorn,

I thought about your comment in https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1084204/=
 again.
What if I add link up check in tegra_pcie_isr() and make "response decoding=
 error"
as debug print? EP Config access will happen when link is down, but "Respon=
se
decoding error" print comes only if debug log is enabled. This way we can a=
void
race issue in config accessors and we get prints when debug logs are enable=
d.

Thierry,
Please share your inputs as well.
