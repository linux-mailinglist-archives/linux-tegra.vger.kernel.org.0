Nice cleanup.

From one of the patches:

This seems like a hard to maintain way to select a few helper functions.
Today we have LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION for the configs that care
about size - and that should work here as well.

I understand where this comes from and I am not against the
solution, but wanted to point at a more modern approach to deal with the
bloat.

Maybe some of the embbedded folks can tell if LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION
can be trusted yet or that is something for the future.

In barebox -ffunction-section (what LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION
enables) is used with success - there it really helps when generating
different barebox images where size matters a lot.
