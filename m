The word "reliable" contradicts to the error-prone approach. On the
other hand, it should be very difficult to change the stubborn
downstream firmware and we want driver to be usable as much as possible,
so in reality not much can be done about it.

It should be fine to support both. This will add complexity to the
driver, thus it needs to be done wisely.

I'll need more time to think about it.
