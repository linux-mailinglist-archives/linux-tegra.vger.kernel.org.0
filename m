I managed to reproduced the problem using unmodified "for-5.5/arm/dt":

 # modprobe cpufreq-dt

[   41.002512] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_core (1100000-1350000)
[   41.007822] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_core (1000000-1350000)
[   41.012475] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_cpu (925000-1250000)
[   41.017299] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_cpu (825000-1250000)
[   41.021842] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_core (950000-1350000)
[   41.025399] regulator_set_voltage: name=vdd_cpu (800000-1250000)

As you can see the voltage drops too much and I know what causes it. The
OPP core was getting some fixes recently, while "for-5.5/arm/dt" uses
older 5.4-rc1 as the base. The problem was introduced in 5.4-rc1 and
then it was fixed by the commit [1] in 5.4-rc5.

[1]
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/opp?h=v5.4-rc5&id=24957db1004353346583c9cc6d783db8f213e3ad

The "for-next" branch has Tegra30 regulators coupling support and I
actually worked around that OPP-core problem in the Tegra's coupler back
in July [2] (see changelog). That explains why "for-next" branch works.

[2] https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/7/25/892

Thus the DT patch doesn't cause any problems. It just happened that the
DT patch is a victim of the 5.4-rc1 OPP-core problem that is already
fixed in rc5.

Jon, anyways thank you for the heads-up. I'll add a patch to blacklist
the cpufreq-dt-platdev in the next iteration to silence the warnings.
