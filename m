given the discussion here [1] and also looking at the coding style patch 
here [2], I think this patch should not be applied. The slave term here 
comes from the I2C protocol (which we can't change) which is listed as an 
exception in [2], see below:

"+Exceptions for introducing new usage is to maintain a userspace ABI/API,
+or when updating code for an existing (as of 2020) hardware or protocol
+specification that mandates those terms. For new specifications
+translate specification usage of the terminology to the kernel coding
+standard where possible.
