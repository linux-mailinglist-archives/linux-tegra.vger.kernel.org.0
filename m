Subject: [PATCH v8 0/9] Couple improvements for Tegra clk driver

This series fixes couple minor standalone problems of the Tegra clk
driver and adds new features.

Changelog:

v8: - Replaced division with a shift, which was suggested by Michał Mirosław
      in a comment to "Handle thermal DIV2 CPU frequency throttling" v7 patch.
      Cortex A9 CPUs don't have hardware divider and shifting is a minor
      improvement here, nevertheless it's good to have it.

    - Added new patch "Don't deassert reset on enabling clocks", which I
      accidentally forgot to include in v7. Previously sound driver
      was a blocker for this patch, the sound is fixed now in v5.13. The
      patch itself is needed for maintaining proper clk/reset sequences
      by PMC and other drivers.

v7: - Added r-b from Rob Herring to the schema patch which he gave to v6.

    - Dropped the MAINTAINERS-update patch. Previously Peter said on IRC
      that he doesn't have time on the tegra-clk driver anymore and approved
      the patch, but then he refused to ack the v6 patch, saying that he
      is not reading mailing lists. So I don't feel comfortable with that
      patch. Peter could send it by himself if will be necessary.

    - Added these new patches:

        clk: tegra: cclk: Handle thermal DIV2 CPU frequency throttling
        clk: tegra: Mark external clocks as not having reset control

      I sent out the new Tegra30 thermal sensor driver and now CPU clock
      could be throttled by the sensor hardware [1]. The first patch adds
      support for reporting of the throttled frequency properly.

      [1] https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-tegra/list/?series=243126

      During of debugging sound issues of Asus Transformer devices, I noticed
      that the external clocks are missing the no-reset flag. The second
      patch fixes it.

v6: - Made a small improvement and corrected a typo in patch
      "Fix refcounting of gate clocks" that were spotted by
      Michał Mirosław.

v5: - Corrected example in the schema binding to silence dt_binding_check
      warning.

    - The Tegra124 binding is factored out into standalone binding since
      Tegra124 has properties that aren't used by other SoCs and I couldn't
      figure out how to make them conditional in schema.

v4: - Added new patch that converts DT bindings to schema.

v3: - Added acks from Thierry Reding that he gave to v2.

    - Added new patch "clk: tegra: Don't allow zero clock rate for PLLs".

v2: - Added these new patches:

      clk: tegra: Halve SCLK rate on Tegra20
      MAINTAINERS: Hand Tegra clk driver to Jon and Thierry

v1: - Collected clk patches into a single series.

Dmitry Osipenko (9):
  clk: tegra30: Use 300MHz for video decoder by default
  clk: tegra: Fix refcounting of gate clocks
  clk: tegra: Ensure that PLLU configuration is applied properly
  clk: tegra: Halve SCLK rate on Tegra20
  clk: tegra: Don't allow zero clock rate for PLLs
  clk: tegra: cclk: Handle thermal DIV2 CPU frequency throttling
  clk: tegra: Mark external clocks as not having reset control
  clk: tegra: Don't deassert reset on enabling clocks
  dt-bindings: clock: tegra: Convert to schema
