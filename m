But its also a scaling factor for the sysclk, then maybe the property
has a wrong name. And you might be right with your suggestion, but
as I said, this breaks sound on my board and whats even worse, it
breaks it for older kernel too, because of the Fixes tag.

Btw I'm pretty sure, the MCLK was enabled and disabled depending on
whether there was an audio stream, the last time I've measured the
clock.

Mark, can this patch please be reverted (with a Fixes tag) until
a proper fix is found which satisfies both needs?
