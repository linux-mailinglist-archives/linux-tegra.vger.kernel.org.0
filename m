Aww, I was literally in the middle of writing a Friday-afternoon patch 
to fix it... still need to build-test, but it's really not looking too 
bad at all:

  drivers/iommu/tegra-gart.c | 53 +++++++++++++++++-----------------
  1 file changed, 27 insertions(+), 26 deletions(-)

After that I was going to clean up the force_aperture confusion. TBH 
I've grown to rather like having this driver around as an exception to 
prove our abstractions and help make sure they make sense - it doesn't 
take much effort to keep it functional, and it's not like there aren't 
plenty of in-tree drivers for hardware even more ancient, obscure and 
less-used than Tegra20. FWIW I have *20*-year-old hardware at home 
running an up-to-date mainline-based distro for a practical purpose, but 
I guess that's considered valid if it says Intel on it? :P

Thanks,
Robin.
