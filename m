Primarily I'm looking at Tegra210 and later, because on earlier devices
the bootloader doesn't consistently initialize display. I know that it
does on some devices, but not all of them. This same code should also
work on Tegra186 and later (with an ARM SMMU) although the situation is
slightly more complicated there because IOMMU translations will fault by
default long before these identity mappings can be established.

No, this is only used to convey information about the active framebuffer
to the kernel. In practice the DMA/IOMMU code will use this information
to establish a 1:1 mapping on whatever IOMMU domain that was picked for
display.

If the devices don't use an IOMMU, then there should be no problem. The
extra reserved-memory nodes would still be necessary to ensure that the
kernel doesn't reuse the framebuffer memory for the slab allocator, but
if no IOMMU is used, then the display controller accessing the memory
isn't going to cause problems other than perhaps scanning out data that
is no longer a framebuffer.

There should also be no problem for devices with an old bootloader
because this code is triggered by the presence of a reserved-memory node
referenced via the memory-region property. Devices with an old
bootloader should continue to work as they did before. Although I
suppose they would start faulting once we enable DMA/IOMMU integration
for Tegra SMMU if they have a bootloader that does initialize display to
actively scan out during boot.

I don't recall reading about that suggestion. So does this mean that for
certain devices we'd want to basically passthrough by default and then
at some point during boot take over with a properly managed IOMMU
domain?

The primary goal here is to move towards using the DMA API rather than
the IOMMU API directly, so we don't really have the option of replacing
with an explicitly created domain. Unless we have code in the DMA/IOMMU
code that does this somehow.

But I'm not sure what would be a good way to mark certain devices as
needing an identity domain by default. Do we still use the reserved-
memory node for that? That would still require some sort of flag to
specify which reserved-memory regions would need this identity mapping
because, as was pointed out in earlier review, some devices may have
reserved-memory regions that are not meant to be identity mapped.

I'm not a big fan of that command-line option, but I also realize that
for older bootloaders that's probably the only option we have. I don't
suppose all of the devices support U-Boot? Because ideally we'd just
translate from tegra_fbmem=3D... to reserved-memory region there so that
we don't have to carry backwards-compatibility code for these purely
downstream bootloaders.
