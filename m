IIUC, the cpufreq already should be prepared for the case where firmware
may override frequency. Viresh, could you please clarify what are the
possible implications of the frequency overriding?

Right

Thanks, it indeed looks similar.

I guess the common thermal pressure update code could be moved out into
a new special cpufreq thermal QoS handler (policy->thermal_constraints),
where handler will select the frequency constraint and set up the
pressure accordingly. So there won't be any races in the code.
