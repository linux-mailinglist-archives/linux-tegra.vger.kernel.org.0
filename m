Thank you for pointer. Added online hook to avoid warning during 
hot-plug-on for the non-boot CPU's while exiting from Suspend-to-RAM. Will
send new version with the changes.

Yes, it boots at a predefined frequency and then some time is taken to 
restore the last frequency which software requested before entering 
Suspend-to-RAM. We don't need to re-write the register again.
