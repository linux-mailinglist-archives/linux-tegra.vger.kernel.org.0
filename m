Given that the SMMU patches have a build-time dependency on the first
patch in the series, and the series depends on the unification series, I
think Krzysztof would have to pull the memory controller branch that I
have with Dmitry's work, apply the unification series on top and then
take patch 1 of this series on top of that. That's the state that you'd
have to pull into the SMMU tree to get the right dependencies.

The SMMU pieces are the leaf of the dependency tree, so technically no
separate branch is needed, because I don't think anybody would have to
pull from it. However, a separate branch might make it easier to back
any of this work out if we have to.

Krzysztof, I do plan on sending out a v3 of the unification series to
address the two cleanups that Dmitry and you have pointed out. After
that I can send out v3 of this series to fix the ordering issue that
Krishna had mentioned. After all of those are applied, would you be able
to provide a stable branch for Will's SMMU tree?

Thierry
