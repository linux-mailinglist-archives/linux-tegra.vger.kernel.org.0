From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

Update the Tegra20 PMC bindings to make use of some advanced json-schema
features such as describing list elements or validating the contents of
string arrays.

While at it, also restructure the pad configuration node schema to make
sure it doesn't accidentally match other properties.
