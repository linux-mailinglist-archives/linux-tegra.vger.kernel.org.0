Sure, but I assume only TF-A talks to MCE and not any OSPM/Linux kernel.

Sounds similar to x86 mwait, perhaps we need to extend PSCI if we need
to make this firmware PSCI compliant or just say it is not and implement
completely independent implementation. I am not saying that is acceptable
ATM but I prefer not to mix some implementation to make it look like
PSCI compliant.

Sounds like a hack/workaround. I would prefer to standardise that. IIUC
the power_state is more static and derived from DT. I don't like to
overload that TBH. Need to check with authors of that binding.

New requirements if this has to be PSCI compliant.

I am worried if different vendors will come up with different custom
solution for this. We need to either standardise this is Linux/DT or
in PSCI.

Sounds like policy and not platform specific to be in DT, but I will leave
that to DT maintainers.
