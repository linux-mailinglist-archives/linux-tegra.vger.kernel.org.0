Thanks for the explanation. I've got another suggestion them. The
semantics of the 'config' reg-space and the ECAM reg-space is very
similar. The only difference is the way the corresponding outbound
iATU window is configured. The DW PCIe driver just maps it in
accordance with the requested peripheral device BDF value so the very
first 4KB is translated to the CFG TLPs sent out to that device. The
same space could be mapped with the
IATU_REGION_CTRL_2_OFF_OUTBOUND_i.CFG_SHIFT_MODE flag set. So the
entire PCIe BDFs space will be available via the same MMIO region.
Thus the corresponding peripheral device will be available at the
BDF-based offset with respect to the 'config' reg-space base address.
Of course in the later case the 'config' MMIO range must be much
greater (256MB) than in the former case (4KB), but still the
difference in just the way the window is configured.  Moreover the DW
PCIe driver could be easier fixed to using the later approach if the
'config' reg-space is specified wide enough to map the entire PCIe bus
CFG-space (256MB).

Based on that and on the fact you said that the ECAM reg-space will be
used by the bootloader/firmware only anyway, I'd suggest to just
extend the 'config' reg-space semantics. So the bootloader/firmware
will be able to use it to create a generic ECAM device. The kernel DW
PCIe driver will by default use it to remap each peripheral device
CFG-space on request, but at some point the driver could be converted
to map the entire PCIe BDFs similarly to the ECAM space. Thus we won't
need to add a redundant ECAM reg-space. What do you think?

* hopefully it isn't too late for the suggested approach.
