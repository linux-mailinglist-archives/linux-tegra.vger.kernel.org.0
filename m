AFAIK, the direct link doesn't exist on any of Tegra boards, they all
have an LVDS bridge. The older device-trees just didn't model it properly.

The LVDS bridge and panel-lvds are relatively new things in DRM, which
allow to model hardware more correctly, like for example the bridge's
powerdown control is now modeled properly.

The nvidia,panel is a mandatory property for the Tegra's DRM output,
panel won't light up without it. I guess it should be possible to get
the panel's phandle from the graph, but this is not supported by the
Tegra's DRM driver + nvidia,panel is also useful to have for older
kernels that do not support panel-lvds. The panel falls back to a
simple-panel in the case of older kernel version, which results in a not
entirely appropriate panel timing (wrong framerate), but this is okay'ish.

Yes, looks like it's not needed. I'll remove it in v3, thanks.

The dtbs_check doesn't complain, should be fine :)

But I don't mind, although the camel-case should be a correct way of
spelling WiFi. I'll change it in v3.

They are generated by the chips.

The PMIC has a built-in 32K oscillator.

The kk3270032 is a dedicated onboard 32K oscillator. This one is not
mandatory to model in the device-tree, but I wanted to model as much as
possible.

Yes, PMIC doesn't model the clock. All Tegra boards model the PMIC's
clock this way, although those boards don't set the clock-output-names
property, which makes the DT model more obscure than it could be.

The kk3270032 is a standalone oscillator, so it's fine as-is already.

I guess the output clock-output-names are already self-explanatory,
don't you think so? For more details you could always consult the
board's schematics.

This could be done, although we already have a precedent in a form of
the paz00 board that got memory timings not so long time ago.

I'll change it in v3.

Thank you for the review.
