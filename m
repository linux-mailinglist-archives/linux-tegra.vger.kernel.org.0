Atm no one knows. What's for sure is that dma-buf fd are meant to
establish sharing, and then once imported everywhere, closed again.
dma-buf heaps might or might be useful for sharing the cross-device
memory allocator problem (the rough idea is that in sysfs every device
lists all the heaps it can use, and then you pick the common one that
works for all devices). But that's for shared buffers only.

For an acceleration driver you want drm gem ids, because yes fd
limits. Also constantly having to reimport dma-buf for every cs ioctl
doesn't sound like a bright idea either, there's a reason we have the
drm_prime cache and all that stuff.

I have also no idea why you wouldn't want to use the existing drm
infrastructure, it's all there.
