Thinking a bit more about how to define the ICC, I'm now leaning to a
variant like this:

interconnects =
    <&mc TEGRA186_MEMORY_CLIENT_BPMP &emc TEGRA_ICC_EMEM>,
    <&mc TEGRA186_MEMORY_CLIENT_BPMPR>,
    <&mc TEGRA186_MEMORY_CLIENT_BPMPW>,
    <&mc TEGRA186_MEMORY_CLIENT_BPMPDMAR>,
    <&mc TEGRA186_MEMORY_CLIENT_BPMPDMAW>;

interconnect-names = "dma-mem", "read", "write", "dma-read", "dma-write";

Looks like there is a problem with having a full MC-EMEM path being
defined for each memory client.. it's not very practical in terms of
memory frequency scaling.

Take Display Controller for example, it has a memory client for each
display (overlay) plane. If planes are not overlapping on the displayed
area, then the required total memory bandwidth equals to the peak
bandwidth selected among of the visible planes. But if planes are
overlapping, then the bandwidths of each overlapped plane are
accumulated because overlapping planes will issue read request
simultaneously for the overlapping areas.

The Memory Controller doesn't have any knowledge about the Display
Controller's specifics. Thus in the end it should be a responsibility of
Display Controller's driver to calculate the required bandwidth for the
hardware unit, since only the driver has all required knowledge about
planes overlapping state and whatnot.

The similar applies to multimedia things, like GPU or Video Decoder.
They have multiple memory clients and (I'm pretty sure that) nobody is
going to calculate memory bandwidth requirements for every client, it's
simply impractical.

So, I'm suggesting that we should have a single "dma-mem" ICC path for
every hardware unit.

The rest of the ICC paths could be memory_client -> memory_controller
paths, providing knobs for things like MC arbitration (latency)
configuration for each memory client. I think this variant of
description is actually closer to the hardware, since the client's
arbitration configuration ends in the Memory Controller.

Please let me know what do you think about the above, thanks in advance.
