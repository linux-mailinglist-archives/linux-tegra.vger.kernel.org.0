It could be a good feature, but I'd want to see how userspace will
benefit from using it in practice before putting effort into it.

Could you please give examples of how this feature will be useful for
userspace? What is the use-case for allocating a single buffer and then
mapping it partially? Is this needed for a userspace memory pool or
something else?

I guess it should be enough for now.

Reservations are needed for the grate drivers, but they need to be done
in conjunction with the DRM scheduler. I guess it should be fine if
you'll remove reservations, I'll then take a look at how to integrate
them and drm-sched on top of yours changes.

I have no doubt that it's better to have static mappings, but it's not
obvious how it should be implemented without seeing a full picture. I
mean that maybe it could be possible to avoid having these special
IOCTLs by changing the way of how hardware is exposed to userspace such
that generic UAPI could be used in order to achieve the same goals.

Perhaps should be fine to start extending the ABI, but then it should
stay under DRM_TEGRA_STAGING until we will be confident that it's all good.
