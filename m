I was more referring to the "support for waits" part, should have 
clarified that.

I don't think there is any need to special case duplicated mappings. I 
think this is a pretty obvious feature to have, but I can rename them to 
reserved0 and reserved1 and require that reserved0 is zero and reserved1 
is the size of the passed GEM object.

 From my point of view, the ABI needs to be designed such that it can 
replace what we have downstream, i.e. it needs to support the usecases 
the downstream nvhost ABI supports currently. Otherwise there is no 
migration path to upstream and it's not worth it for me to work on this.

Although, I don't see what this ABI is missing that your userspace would 
rely on. Does it submit jobs in reverse order that would deadlock if 
drm_sched didn't reorder them based on prefences, or something?

Software-based scheduling might make sense in situations where the 
channel is shared by all processes, but at least for modern chips that 
are designed to use hardware scheduling, I want to use that capability.
