Thank you very much for the clarification.

It's probably not a big problem for something monolithic and customized
like ChromeOS to issue a software update in order to take into account
all specifics of a particular device, but this doesn't work nicely for a
generic software, like a usual Linux distro.

>> AFAIK, things like Xorg modesetting don't support that orientation property.

In my case it's not only the display panel which is upside-down, but
also the touchscreen. Hence both display output and touchscreen input
need to be rotated at once, otherwise you'll end up with either display
or input being upside-down.

The 180° rotation should be free on NVIDIA Tegra. There are no known
limitations for the planes and BSP kernel video driver handles the
plane's coordinates/framebuffer rotation within the driver.

The kernel's input subsystem allows us to transparently (for userspace)
remap the touchscreen input (by specifying generic touchscreen
device-tree properties), while this is not the case for the DRM subsystem.

@Thierry, @Sean, @Daniel, could you please help me to understand how a
coordinated display / input rotation could be implemented, making the
rotation transparent to the user (i.e. avoiding xorg.conf hacking and
etc)? It should be nice if display's output could be flipped within the
DRM driver, hiding this fact from userspace.

Will it be okay if we'll add a transparent-rotation support specifically
to the Tegra DRM driver? For example if device-tree contains
nvidia,display-flip-y property, then the Tegra DRM driver will take care
of rotating coordinates/framebuffer of the display planes.
