In kernel's boot order:

1) Host1x is attached to exclusive implicit domain
2) Host1x is detached from the implicit domain and attached to explicit
3) Both DC's fail to attach to implicit domain because DMA-mapping code
doesn't take into account multiple devices in the same group.
4) GR2D is attached to exclusive implicit domain
5) GR3D is attached to exclusive implicit domain
6) VDE is attached to exclusive implicit domain
7) VDE is detached from the implicit domain and attached to explicit
8) DC client is trying to attach to DRM domain in
host1x_client_iommu_attach() and that fails because tegra-smmu code
allocates ASID in tegra_smmu_attach_dev()->tegra_smmu_as_prepare() (i.e.
on IOMMU group's attaching) and all ASIDs are already busy.

Hence if DRM sub-device drivers are detaching from the implicit domain
on probe, then the problem is getting worked around because there are
available ASIDs at the time of host1x clients initialization.
