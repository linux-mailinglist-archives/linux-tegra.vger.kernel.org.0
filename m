I had some hopes because I saw that NVIDIA still tests new kernel
releases on T124 Jetson, although I don't know how much is tested.
The kernel seems to be in pretty good shape, save for those issues.

I found that graphics are a bigger problem: X is dog slow, and I get
black glxgears window and some 150fps, which doesn't look great.

Do you know if it's supposed to be like that or if it's a regression
or some screwup on my side? I have enabled Nouveau in the kernel and
installed X11 Nouveau driver and xorg.log shows that it loads.

Are there any other options besides Nouveau? Perhaps some newer L4T
release which would work with mainline host1x driver and Kepler? I
suppose anything that works on Jetson will work on Nyan too.

Currently this machine runs Ubuntu 14.04 L4T and 3.10 CrOS kernel,
so practically anything would be an improvement :)

I see that a few other drivers which bother to implement this callback
convert ns to clocks, so options would be to copy-paste their code or
put that stuff in SPI core. I have never looked at SPI before...

Fair enough, it's not a huge deal.

I actually have the schematic from some shady laptop repair website.
IIRC the touchpad runs from some major 3.3V rail which is always on,
so I didn't bother fixing this yet.

I also learned something new, that platform drivers can ask for their
probe to be deferred, which was responsible for some other warnings.
At this point I'm not sure if anything serious remains, but regulators
are another subsystem I know practically nothing about.

I made zero progress on this, and frankly didn't even try. Serial ports
are only accessible by soldering to the board. I suppose I could try a
USB dongle, but it will go dark as soon as xhci is suspended.

Yep, this exactly. I have fixed it already.

Thanks,
