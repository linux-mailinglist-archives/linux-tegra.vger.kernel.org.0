I really do not understand what you are asking for here.

Worst case, just say:
	cc: stable... # 4.4.x

and if you know that fails to apply or build, then just wait for my
email saying something failed and then respond with the needed commit
ids or backported patches.

It's not rocket science, and this isn't all that automated, I _can_
handle free-form text :)
