Interesting.. my understanding that the rotation property is supposed to
be a generic property which represents physical orientation of a display
panel and hence it should be applicable to all panels.

There are quite a lot of panel drivers and I'm a bit doubtful that at
least half of devices that use those panels have any real use for the
rotation property. I could write the patches.. but in the end it could
be a wasted effort if nobody needs it, so I'd prefer not to do it.
