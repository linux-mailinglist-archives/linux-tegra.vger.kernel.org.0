Ping.
Please suggest if we can add compatible string in the '/cpus' node.
If not then i propose accepting the current patch to get BPMP data 
without adding any property in respective driver's DT node.
We can push separate patch later if we need to add compatible string in 
the '/cpus' node or create new DT node for cpufreq.

Regards,
Sumit
