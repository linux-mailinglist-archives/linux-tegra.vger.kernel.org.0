I think you're misunderstanding what kind of firmware it is. It absolutely can't be used
with upstream kernel without of porting the whole downstream driver stack (which is a very
old crusty v3.1 kernel, a typical non-upstreamable downstream hackery). In upstream we now
have a proper DRM graphics driver, video decoder driver and etc. Few years ago those
downstream drivers were obsoleted and not supported by the NVIDIA anymore.

As I just said in the above, that old firmware is not usable with the upstream in any shape
or form. Hence there is nothing to detect, it is safe to assume that only newer hardware has
something running in background. Peter De Schrijver suggested that kernel shouldn't touch
the COP's interrupts for the newer firmware, so this patch should be fine if Peter or
somebody else from NVIDIA will give an ACK.
