Yes.

I thought this was already in there, as others have done it in the past.

It's a _very_ exotic case, I wouldn't worry about it, just document it
like this, and if I have problems applying the patches to stable I'll be
sure to let you know and you can always tell me then.  That's usually
the easiest thing to do anyway :)
