Yea, that's exactly what I described in the commit message of a
later version of this patch. Yet, we can drop it now as a device
will probe() and call ->probe_device() again.

As my previous reply to Dmitry above, I don't think it'd happen,
given that mc/smmu drivers are inited during arch_initcall stage
while all clients should be probed during device_initcall stage,
once this rework patch gets merged.

Well, I have answered him, and also removed the mc/smmu check in
v6 already.
