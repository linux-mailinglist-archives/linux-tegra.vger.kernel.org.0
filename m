We always want at least 2 of the 3 instances >>programmed and so we should only match 'nvidia,tegra194-smmu'. In fact, I think that we also need to update the arm_smmu_of_match table to add 'nvidia,tegra194-smmu' with the data set to &arm_mmu500.

Yup, that sounds OK to me if you want a broader compatible to 
potentially match other future SoCs as well.

> Others probably having their own implementation based on V2 arch.

Exactly - "cavium,smmu-v2" and "qcom,smmu-v2" are their own in-house 
microarchitectures, not one of Arm's designs, so they don't really have 
a suitable 'product name' we could have used for the bindings.
