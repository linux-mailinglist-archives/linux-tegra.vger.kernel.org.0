But it doesn't stop you from disabling OF_RESERVED_MEM. The Kconfig
dependencies should reflect the build and runtime requirements of the
driver, otherwise only driver author knows which config options are need.

Indeed, the QCOM driver isn't compile-tested as much as it could be.
That driver already shouldn't have any problems with compile-testing,
maybe some stubs were missing when driver was originally added.

For the universal compile-testing it should be enough to fix the stub.
We may consider other options if it won't be enough, thank you for the
suggestions.
