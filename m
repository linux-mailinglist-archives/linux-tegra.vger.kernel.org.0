If not too late, would you mind dropping this patch for v5.10?

The patch was working for me locally, but when testing on more boards, I
actually found this broke CPUFREQ support on some Tegra186 boards. The
reason is that the boot frequency may not be in the frequency table on
all boards. The boot frequency is constant across all boards, but the
frequency table can vary slightly with device. Therefore, for some
boards, such as mine, the boot frequency is found the in frequency table
but this is not always the case.

Now that you have made the warning an info print, this change is not
really needed and the simplest thing to do is dropped this completely.
Sorry about that.

Jon
