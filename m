The service drivers (AER, hotplug, etc) don't know whether the
interrupt is INTx or MSI; they just register their ISRs with
pcie_device.irq.

The point of this patch is that the PCI core doesn't support devices
that use MSI and INTx at the same time, and since this device can't
generate MSI for PME, we have to use INTx for *all* its interrupts.

Is there any possibility this hardware would be used in an ACPI
system?  If so, the quirk should probably stay in drivers/pci/quirks.c
because the DWC driver would not be present.

Either way, please also add some PCIe spec references about this in
the changelog and a comment in the code about working around this
issue.  I think the MSI/MSI-X sections that prohibit a device from
using both INTx and MSI/MSI-X are probably the most pertinent.

The reason I want a comment about this is to discourage future
hardware from following this example because every device that *does*
follow this example requires a kernel update that would be otherwise
unnecessary.
