Why you haven't addressed any of the previous review comments? There
were some obvious problems in v7 and v8 still has them.

It should be a bit too early to push it into kernel. The UAPI is not
ready because it's missing essential features. We can't call this a
'modern UABI' until it's fully implemented. The design decisions are
still questionable because this UAPI is built around the proprietary
firmware (and based on UAPI of downstream driver) which doesn't fit well
into DRM world. I haven't got all the answers to my previous questions,
should I repeat them?

UAPI is not the only problem that we have. The performance and stability
of the driver are in a very bad shape too. The modern UAPI can't be
built on top of the old code. It's clear now that this is a very serious
problem that must be addressed along with the UAPI work and I'm getting
silence from you guys.
