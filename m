Right, you already wrote it in the first email in this thread, I just
reversed words in my head... Then as you wrote - take Dmitry's changes
and share them via pull to me. I'll put on top the unification series,
then #1 from this SMMU series and finally I'll provide a pull request
for Will so his SMMU can go on.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
