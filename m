Subject: [PATCH v11 00/10] Introduce memory interconnect for NVIDIA Tegra SoCs
Date:   Thu,  3 Dec 2020 22:24:29 +0300
Message-Id: <20201203192439.16177-1-digetx@gmail.com>

This series brings initial support for memory interconnect to Tegra20,
Tegra30 and Tegra124 SoCs.

For the starter only display controllers and devfreq devices are getting
interconnect API support, others could be supported later on. The display
controllers have the biggest demand for interconnect API right now because
dynamic memory frequency scaling can't be done safely without taking into
account bandwidth requirement from the displays. In particular this series
fixes distorted display output on T30 Ouya and T124 TK1 devices.

Changelog:

v11: - Added acks from Georgi Djakov.

     - CC'ed devicetree@vger.kernel.org in order to make the dt-bindings
       patch ("Document opp-supported-hw property") visible to the DT
       maintainers.

     - Rebased on a recent linux-next, note that some of v10 DT patches
       were already applied by Thierry into tegra tree, as well as one
       devfreq patch which removed the older tegra20-devfreq driver was
       applied by Chanwoo Choi to the devfreq tree.

     - Note that patch "memory: tegra20: Support hardware versioning and
       clean up OPP table initialization" fixes the noisy (but harmless)
       warning which happens because DT patches were applied before the
       code changes. This problem was spotted in current linux-next by
       Jonathan Hunter, hence could be worthwhile to pick up this patch
       for the v5.11.

v10 - In a longer run it will be much nicer if we could support EMC
      hardware versioning on Tegra20 and it's not late to support it now.
      Hence I added these new patches:

        dt-bindings: memory: tegra20: emc: Document opp-supported-hw property
        memory: tegra20: Support hardware versioning and clean up OPP table initialization

    - Removed error message from tegra30-devfreq driver about missing OPP
      properties in a device-tree because EMC driver already prints that
      message and it uses OPP API error code instead of checking DT directly,
      which is a more correct way of doing that.

v9: - Squashed "memory: tegra30-emc: Factor out clk initialization" into
      patch "tegra30: Support interconnect framework".
      Suggested by Krzysztof Kozlowski.

    - Improved Kconfig in the patch "memory: tegra124-emc: Make driver modular"
      by adding CONFIG_TEGRA124_CLK_EMC entry, which makes clk-driver changes
      to look a bit more cleaner. Suggested by Krzysztof Kozlowski.

    - Dropped voltage regulator support from ICC and DT patches for now
      because there is a new discussion about using a power domain abstraction
      for controlling the regulator, which is likely to happen.

    - Replaced direct "operating-points-v2" property checking in EMC drivers
      with checking of a returned error code from dev_pm_opp_of_add_table().
      Note that I haven't touched T20 EMC driver because it's very likely
      that we'll replace that code with a common helper soon anyways.
      Suggested by Viresh Kumar.

    - The T30 DT patches now include EMC OPP changes for Ouya board, which
      is available now in linux-next.
