I had a discussion with our hardware engineers and we are of the opinion
that the root port is not really broken w.r.t MSI as spec doesn't clearly
say that if root port advertises MSI support, it must generate MSI interrupts
for PME. All that it says is, if MSI is enabled, then MSI should be raised
for PME events. Here, by 'enable', we understand that as enabling at
hardware level to generate MSI interrupt which is not the case with Tegra194.
In Tegra194, root port is enabled to generate MSI only for hot-plug events and
legacy interrupts are used for PME, AER. Having said that I'm fine to add a
quick based on Vendor-ID and Device-IDs of root port in Tegra194 to set
pdev->no_msi to '1'.
