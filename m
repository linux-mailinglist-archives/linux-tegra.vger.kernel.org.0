This is probably not the case, since runtime resume for I2S would have=20
already enabled the clock for I2S and in turn PLLA. The hw_param() call=20
would happen later.
We could have used a fixed clock rate for PLLA, but the reason why we=20
are setting the rate at runtime is, we support sample rates (and=20
multuples) of 8kHz and 11.025kHz.
Both of these require a different PLLA base rate for downstream clock=20
dividers to work properly. That is why, I think we have two base rates=20
for PLLA.

Even if we want to enable the clocks (for i2s) in hw_param(), this still=20
may not help.
For example there could be multiple I2S instances, which can use the=20
same PLLA source. ALSA playback/capture on different I2S can run=20
independently.
Hence we are not sure if clk_disable_unprepare() in tegra_asoc_utils.c=20
would actually disable PLLA. Hence I think the problem exists in current=20
code too.

We really want to allow user to run any sample rate in the supported=20
range. However the sample rate is known during hw_param() callback.

Looking at current discussion, we may have to provide an aternate way of=20
switching PLLA base rate (may be not in ALSA callbacks)
