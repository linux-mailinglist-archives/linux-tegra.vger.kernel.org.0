OK, so you actually want system-wide PM to work like PM-runtime on the
platform in question, but there are substantial differences.

First, PM-runtime suspend can be effectively disabled by user space
and system-wide suspend is always expected to work.

Second, if system wakeup devices are involved, their handling during
system-wide suspend depends on the return value of device_may_wakeup()
which depends on what user space does, whereas PM-runtime assumes
device wakeup to be always enabled.

And then *somebody* would have to chase a ton of subtle issues
resulting from that.  No, thanks, but no thanks.

You are still not saying what happens if user space doesn't allow
PM-runtime to suspend the devices (by writing "on" to their "control"
files).

Well, no, that's not the reason.  The real reason is that the handling
of that device during system-wide suspend does not follow the rules
followed by PM-runtime for it.

Switching system-wide PM over to PM-runtime to address that is not
going to work, because PM-runtime is not mandatory and system-wide PM
is.

So this logic needs to be implemented in the system-wide suspend flow as well.

Runtime suspend is, runtime resume isn't until the "late" suspend phase.

So this is a bug in the system-wide suspend/resume flow that needs to
be addressed, but not by switching it over to PM-runtime.

So there needs to be another way.

Have you looked at DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND?

Runtime resume during system-wide suspend and resume is basically fine
unless you try to do it in the "late" suspend phase or later, but that
limitation is kind of artificial.  [I was talking about that at the
LPC this year.]  It basically cannot be carried out in the part of
system-wide suspend after the core regards the device and its parent
etc as "suspended", but the definition of that may be adjusted IMO.

And using PM-runtime resume during system-wide resume may be fine too,
basically (as long as the ordering of that is not lead to any kind of
loop dependencies).

On the other hand, there is *zero* need for runtime suspend during
system-wide transitions and it is known problematic.

That's a problem with genpd, I'd say.

No, it wouldn't.

Also your arguments are mostly about PM-runtime resume, which is a
different story.
