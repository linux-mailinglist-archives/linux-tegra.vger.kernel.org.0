I don't think that the MC driver will stay built-in forever, although
its modularization is complicated right now. Hence something shall keep
the reference to the MC device resources while they are in use and this
patch takes care of doing that.

Secondly, the Nicolin's patch doesn't pretend on anything, but rather
brings the already existing duplicated code to a single common place.
