Hi,

Thermal pressure is letting scheduler know that the max capacity 
available for a cpu to schedule tasks is reduced due to a thermal event.
So you cannot have a h/w thermal pressure and s/w thermal pressure. 
There is eventually only one capping applied at h/w level and the 
frequency corresponding to this capping should be used for thermal pressure.

Ideally you should not be having both s/w and h/w trying to throttle at 
the same time. Why is this a scenario and what prevents you from 
disabling s/w throttling when h/w throttling is enabled. Now if there 
has to a aggregation for whatever reason this should be done at the 
thermal driver level and passed to scheduler.

It was a conscious decision to keep thermal pressure update out of qos 
max freq update because there are platforms that don't use the qos 
framework. For eg acpi uses cpufreq_update_policy.
But you are right. We have two platforms now applying h/w throttling and 
cpufreq_cooling applying s/w throttling. So it does make sense to have 
one api doing all the computation to update thermal pressure. I am not 
sure how exactly/where exactly this will reside.

So for starters, I think you should replicate the update of thermal 
pressure in your h/w driver when you know that h/w is 
throttling/throttled the frequency. You can refer to cpufreq_cooling.c 
to see how it is done.

Moving to a common api can be done as a separate patch series.
