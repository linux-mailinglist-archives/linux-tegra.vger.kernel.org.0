It is after PERST is deasserted and before making the first check for DLActive+
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-tegra194.c?h=v5.4-rc7#n816
and dw_pcie_wait_for_link() has maximum timeout of 1sec before bailing out
Anyway, in this case, link is coming up within 100ms but config space is not accessible as device returns CRS.

I tried out the above patch that you came up with.
Couple of points here.
In Tegra194, we put the endpoint to D0 explicitly (instead of leaving it in D3Hot)
and then go for link transition to L2 (because of Tegra specific reasons).
Even if I comment out the API in pcie-tegra194.c which puts the devices back into D0
(from D3Hot) just before going for L2 transition, device is in D3Hot but not in D3Cold
So, if (prev_state == PCI_D3cold) didn't work really.
Also, I'm wondering why should there be a check in the first place anyway?
why can't pci_dev_wait() be called always?
