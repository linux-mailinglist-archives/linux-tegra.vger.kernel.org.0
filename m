Treating pm_runtime_suspend() and pm_runtime_resume() as the low-level
device power off and power on routines for the given platform is a
mistake.  It has always been a mistake and I'm not going to accept
changes trying to make it look like it isn't a mistake.

If any generic power off and power on helpers for DT-based platforms
are needed, add them and make PM-runtime use them.  That should be
straightforward enough.

Thanks!
