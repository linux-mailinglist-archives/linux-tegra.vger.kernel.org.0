Before this patch, part of this was already happening. That is,
simple-audio-card called set_sysclk(samplerate * mclk-fs), then
the codec figured out that its mclk was different than the
requested sample rate and enabled its FLL to generate the requested
sample rate automatically.

With this patch applied, simple-audio-card already tries to change
mclk, which isn't working in my case (the MCLK isn't generated by
a PLL and just supports fixed frequencies) and thus breaks audio. And
this patch also propagate to the stable kernels and breaks my
board there, too.

For simple-audio-card you can set the "clock" property if you want
that clock to be changed/enabled/disabled. But that doesn't seem to
be the way to go, at least it was NAKed by Rob for the audio-graph-card.
I don't see a way to figure out if MCLK should be controlled by
simple-*-card without adding further properties to the device tree.

To be frank, I don't see that happening.
