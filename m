I gave this a try and came up with the following:

--- >8 ---
diff --git a/arch/arm64/boot/dts/nvidia/tegra194.dtsi b/arch/arm64/boot/dts=
/nvidia/tegra194.dtsi

=20
--- >8 ---

Now I can do something rougly like this, although I have a more complete
patch locally that also gets rid of all the global variables because we
now actually have a struct platform_device that we can anchor everything
at:

--- >8 ---
static const struct of_device_id tegra194_cpufreq_of_match[] =3D {
	{ .compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra194-ccplex", },
	{ /* sentinel */ }
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, tegra194_cpufreq_of_match);

static struct platform_driver tegra194_ccplex_driver =3D {
	.driver =3D {
		.name =3D "tegra194-cpufreq",
		.of_match_table =3D tegra194_cpufreq_of_match,
	},
	.probe =3D tegra194_cpufreq_probe,
	.remove =3D tegra194_cpufreq_remove,
};
module_platform_driver(tegra194_ccplex_driver);
--- >8 ---

I don't think that's exactly what Rafael (Cc'ed) had in mind, since the
above thread seems to have mostly talked about binding a driver to each
individual CPU.

But this seems a lot better than having to instantiate a device from
scratch just so that a driver can bind to it and it allows additional
properties to be associated with the CCPLEX device.

Rob, any thoughts on this from a device tree point of view? The /cpus
bindings don't mention the compatible property, but there doesn't seem
to be anything in the bindings that would prohibit its use.

If we can agree on that, I can forward my local changes to Sumit for
inclusion or reference.
