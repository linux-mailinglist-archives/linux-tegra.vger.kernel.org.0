-Tegra124 SOCTHERM thermal management system
-
-The SOCTHERM IP block contains thermal sensors, support for polled
-or interrupt-based thermal monitoring, CPU and GPU throttling based
-on temperature trip points, and handling external overcurrent
-notifications. It is also used to manage emergency shutdown in an
-overheating situation.
-
-Required properties :
-- compatible : For Tegra124, must contain "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm".
-  For Tegra132, must contain "nvidia,tegra132-soctherm".
-  For Tegra210, must contain "nvidia,tegra210-soctherm".
-- reg : Should contain at least 2 entries for each entry in reg-names:
-  - SOCTHERM register set
-  - Tegra CAR register set: Required for Tegra124 and Tegra210.
-  - CCROC register set: Required for Tegra132.
-- reg-names :  Should contain at least 2 entries:
-  - soctherm-reg
-  - car-reg
-  - ccroc-reg
-- interrupts : Defines the interrupt used by SOCTHERM
-- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
-  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
-- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
-  - tsensor
-  - soctherm
-- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
-  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
-- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
-  - soctherm
-- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 1. For a description of this property, see
-     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal-sensor.yaml.
-    See <dt-bindings/thermal/tegra124-soctherm.h> for a list of valid values
-    when referring to thermal sensors.
-- throttle-cfgs: A sub-node which is a container of configuration for each
-    hardware throttle events. These events can be set as cooling devices.
-  * throttle events: Sub-nodes must be named as "light" or "heavy".
-      Properties:
-      - nvidia,priority: Each throttles has its own throttle settings, so the
-        SW need to set priorities for various throttle, the HW arbiter can select
-        the final throttle settings.
-        Bigger value indicates higher priority, In general, higher priority
-        translates to lower target frequency. SW needs to ensure that critical
-        thermal alarms are given higher priority, and ensure that there is
-        no race if priority of two vectors is set to the same value.
-        The range of this value is 1~100.
-      - nvidia,cpu-throt-percent: This property is for Tegra124 and Tegra210.
-        It is the throttling depth of pulse skippers, it's the percentage
-        throttling.
-      - nvidia,cpu-throt-level: This property is only for Tegra132, it is the
-        level of pulse skippers, which used to throttle clock frequencies. It
-        indicates cpu clock throttling depth, and the depth can be programmed.
-        Must set as following values:
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_LOW, TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_MED
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_HIGH, TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_NONE
-      - nvidia,gpu-throt-level: This property is for Tegra124 and Tegra210.
-        It is the level of pulse skippers, which used to throttle clock
-        frequencies. It indicates gpu clock throttling depth and can be
-        programmed to any of the following values which represent a throttling
-        percentage:
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_NONE (0%)
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_LOW (50%),
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_MED (75%),
-        TEGRA_SOCTHERM_THROT_LEVEL_HIGH (85%).
-      - #cooling-cells: Should be 1. This cooling device only support on/off state.
-        For a description of this property see:
-	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal-cooling-devices.yaml
-
-      Optional properties: The following properties are T210 specific and
-      valid only for OCx throttle events.
-      - nvidia,count-threshold: Specifies the number of OC events that are
-        required for triggering an interrupt. Interrupts are not triggered if
-        the property is missing. A value of 0 will interrupt on every OC alarm.
-      - nvidia,polarity-active-low: Configures the polarity of the OC alaram
-        signal. If present, this means assert low, otherwise assert high.
-      - nvidia,alarm-filter: Number of clocks to filter event. When the filter
-        expires (which means the OC event has not occurred for a long time),
-        the counter is cleared and filter is rearmed. Default value is 0.
-      - nvidia,throttle-period-us: Specifies the number of uSec for which
-        throttling is engaged after the OC event is deasserted. Default value
-        is 0.
-
-Optional properties:
-- nvidia,thermtrips : When present, this property specifies the temperature at
-  which the soctherm hardware will assert the thermal trigger signal to the
-  Power Management IC, which can be configured to reset or shutdown the device.
-  It is an array of pairs where each pair represents a tsensor id followed by a
-  temperature in milli Celcius. In the absence of this property the critical
-  trip point will be used for thermtrip temperature.
-
-Note:
-- the "critical" type trip points will be used to set the temperature at which
-the SOC_THERM hardware will assert a thermal trigger if the "nvidia,thermtrips"
-property is missing. When the thermtrips property is present, the breach of a
-critical trip point is reported back to the thermal framework to implement
-software shutdown.
-
-- the "hot" type trip points will be set to SOC_THERM hardware as the throttle
-temperature. Once the temperature of this thermal zone is higher
-than it, it will trigger the HW throttle event.
-

-
-	soctherm@700e2000 {
-		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-soctherm";

+      When present, this property specifies the temperature at which the

+      Management IC, which can be configured to reset or shutdown the device.
+      It is an array of pairs where each pair represents a tsensor ID followed
+      by a temperature in milli Celcius. In the absence of this property the
+      critical trip point will be used for thermtrip temperature.
+
+      Note:
+      - the "critical" type trip points will be used to set the temperature at
+        which the SOCTHERM hardware will assert a thermal trigger if the
+        "nvidia,thermtrips" property is missing.  When the thermtrips property
+        is present, the breach of a critical trip point is reported back to
+        the thermal framework to implement software shutdown.
+
+      - the "hot" type trip points will be set to SOCTHERM hardware as the
+        throttle temperature.  Once the temperature of this thermal zone is
+        higher than it, it will trigger the HW throttle event.
