Yeah, that was the closest case I could think of as well, but I'd really 
rather not encourage people to abuse DT that way. If a kernel driver is 
loading firmware and initialising the device from scratch then it should 
be able to sort everything out at runtime without DT involvement. Even 
if the firmware is somehow massive enough to warrant an early dynamic 
carveout rather than a regular page/CMA allocation, there's still no 
good excuse for the driver not to manage its own address space constraints.

On the other hand if the device really does need its firmware at a 
specific hard-coded address than that would need a fixed physical 
reservation anyway, since the DT can't assume that the OS is definitely 
going to use IOMMU translation.

Thanks,
Robin.
