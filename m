1. Device shall be in RPM-suspended state at the time of driver's
removal, unless there is a bug in the sound driver. Hence why do you
need the dead code which doesn't bring any practical value?

2. Making changes underneath of RPM is simply error-prone. It may hit
badly in the future once something will change in the RPM core.
