The problem is caused by the support of dynamic memory frequency scaling
which does a good job at keeping memory in a low power state during idle
time. So display controller may not get enough bandwidth at the start of
scanout if it won't request BW beforehand. This problem existed for many
years on T124 and now T20/30 are also affected. The DC of T20 is the
least tolerant to memory bandwidth troubles.

This problem is not critical, but it hurts user experience since high
resolution modes may not work at all and display output may become
distorted, requiring a DC reset.

Thank you for the explanation! It's not uncommon to forget about
patches, so the silence worries me. I hoped that both the dynamic freq
scaling and display BW support would be merged around the same time, but
apparently we got a disconnect here.
