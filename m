It would be useful to switch the power state terminology to the one used
for later chips:

LP0 becomes SC7
LP1 becomes C1
LP2 becomes CC7

Meaning of these states is as follows

C is a core state:

C1 clock gating
C2 not defined
C3 not defined
C4 not defined
C5 not defined
C6 not defined for ARM cores
C7 power-gating

CC is a CPU cluster C state:

CC1 cluster clock gated
CC2 not defined
CC3 fmax@Vmin: not used prior to Tegra186
CC4: cluster retention: no longer supported
CC5: not defined
CC6: cluster power gating
CC7: cluster rail gating

SC is a System C state:

SC1: not defined
SC2: not defined
SC3: not defined
SC4: not defined
SC5: not defined
SC6: not defined
SC7: VDD_SOC off

Cheers,

Peter.
