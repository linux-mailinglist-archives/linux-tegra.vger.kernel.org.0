Did I get this right? The core domain is the parent to the PMC domain?

So, the PMC domain doesn't have an OPP table associated with it, but
some of its attached devices may still have available OPPs, which
should be managed through the parent domain (core domain). Correct?

Is there a DT patch in the series that I can look at that shows how
this is encoded?

Hmm, I have the feeling that we should try to manage in some generic
way in genpd, rather than having to deal with it here.

Why not let the driver deal with this instead? It should be able to
probe its device, no matter what state the bootloader has put the
device into.

To me, it sounds like a call to dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state()
(perhaps via dev_pm_opp_set_opp() or dev_pm_opp_set_rate()) from the
driver itself, should be sufficient?

I understand that it means the domain may change the OPP during boot,
without respecting a vote for a device that has not been probed yet.
But is there a problem with this?

Kind regards
Uffe
