I looped in Greg to pick his brain, since it is unclear how we should
apply the stable kernel rules on this specific patch. Basically, this
technically is not a bug, it is just bad code that forces a feature on
ALL kernels that compile the PCI Tegra Controller driver in the kernel.
I would really really want to have this patch applied to all stable
kernels but first as you said it is better to apply it to mainline and
check it does not cause any issues on any other arch/platform then
we can think about backporting it to stable kernels.

I am not happy to force Relaxed Ordering on any PCIe device on
any platform/arch compiling PCI Tegra controller in, so somehow
we must rectify this situation, this is gross as I said before.

I added a Fixes: tag but I am not sure it is appropriate for the
above to happen and I think it is better for this patch to brew
at least a release cycle in the mainline before sending it back
to stable kernels, if appropriate, how to translate this into
stable kernel rules that's the question I am asking.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
