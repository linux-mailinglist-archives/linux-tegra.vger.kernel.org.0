The only driver I'm aware of which effectively tore down mappings by 
freeing its pagetable on detach was sprd-iommu, and that was recently 
fixed on account of it being clearly wrong.

Remember that the GART registers here are literally just its pagetable, 
nothing more.

Yes, I'm not disputing that we expect detach to remove that device's 
*access* to the IOVA (which is what GART can't do...), but it should 
absolutely not destroy the IOVA mapping itself. Follow that sequence 
with iommu_attach_device(dom, dev) again and the caller can expect to be 
able to continue using the same translation.

Groups are in fact the most practical example: set up a VFIO domain, 
attach two groups to it, map some IOVAs, detach one of the groups, keep 
using the other. If the detach carried an implicit iommu_unmap() there 
would be fireworks.

They are, in the sense that accesses within the aperture won't go 
anywhere. It might help if domain->geometry.force_aperture was 
meaningful, because it's never been clear whether it was supposed to 
reflect a hardware capability (in which case it should be false for 
GART) or be an instruction to the user of the domain (wherein it's a bit 
pointless that everyone always sets it).

Thanks,
Robin.
