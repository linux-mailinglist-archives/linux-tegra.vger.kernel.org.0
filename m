By default, author's patches are assumed to be tested, otherwise we
would be putting own Tested-by in most of the cases (ideally: in all).
Just because you do not see author's Tested-by everywhere it does not
mean that author did not test it...

Testing is also a requirement:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst#L35

Therefore if your non-trivial patches are not tested, please also
mention it with RFT or after '---'.

I applied it without your tested-by. If the tested platform is anyhow
relevant, just mention it in the commit msg.

Best regards,
