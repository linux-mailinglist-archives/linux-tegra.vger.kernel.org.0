Hmm, yeah, I suppose the iommu_group/<n>/devices/ dir just didn't get 
populated and nobody noticed or cared (which TBH doesn't really surprise 
me for a case where a kernel driver is expected to manage the IOMMU 
anyway such that it's pretty much irrelevant to userspace).

I've considered that before - arguably it could have been removed when 
Mikko implemented the full bus model, but now I kind of don't want to 
since it's one of the remaining few that *is* still in the right place 
where it's always meant to be. The correct fix to meet the original 
expectations *should* be simply:

...except you've now also broken that at the same time by removing the 
dev->bus check from of_iommu_configure() :(

> Robin do you know more? Specifically where is the "soon be run again"?

I can't say why it's done in quite such a roundabout manner by 
host1x_subdev_register(), but as I called out, we quickly get to the 
actual device_add() call, wherein things proceed as normal. The only 
thing going wrong here is that we "replay" the iommu_probe_device() call 
*before* it ever could have happened normally.

Frankly, for all you protest whenever I call you out for demonstrating a 
lack of understanding of this tangled mess, I sure do seem to spend a 
lot of time explaining it to you... :/

I've never claimed it's *not* a horrible mess, but at the risk of 
repeating myself, it *is* fragile, and the consequences of mucking about 
with it are tricky to reason about even when one does understand all the 
history of how it's intended to work vs. what actually happens. To coin 
a phrase I find enjoyable, this is definitely "F around and find out" 
code; as this and other threads show, now you're well into the finding 
out part.

> Was the above issue fixed in commit 07397df29e57 ("dma-mapping: move
> dma configuration to bus infrastructure") ?

Um, no. That commit was no more than code movement essentially 
separating PCI from non-PCI configuration; merely host1x didn't need to 
share the full path which ended up as platform_dma_configure() since 
host1x doesn't support ACPI. Once again the fact that I've had to 
explain that drives me to utter despair...

Robin.
