It looks correct to me. Would be helpful to have some comment of course
that we're setting a default req_rate because we want a
clk_set_rate_range() before clk_set_rate() to work properly when this
clk is initially an orphan. We should be able to code up a test case for
that too by registering an orphan and then registering the parent and
then calling clk_set_rate_range().
