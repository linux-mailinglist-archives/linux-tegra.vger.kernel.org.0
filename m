Also gave this a go on one of NXP's layerscape platforms, and 
encountered the same issue. However, given that in our case it's not 
about a framebuffer device but a firmware, it cause it to crash. :-(

Another apparent problem is that in the current implementation only one 
memory-region per device is supported. Actually it appears that this is 
a limitation of the DT reservation binding - it doesn't seem to allow 
specifying multiple regions per device. In our firmware case we would 
need support for multiple reserved regions (FW memory, FW i/o registers 
a.s.o).
