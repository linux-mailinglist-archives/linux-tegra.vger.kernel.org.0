The registers dump should be good for everyone because it's a
self-explanatory information for anyone who is familiar with the
hardware. I don't think there is a need for anything else than what is
proposed in this patch, at least for now. I also simply don't see any
other better way to debug the state of this particular hardware, again
this logging is for the driver developers and not for users.

Initially, I was temporarily adding the debug messages. Now they are
pretty much mandatory for verifying that driver is working properly. And
of course the debugging messages got into the shape of this patch after
several iterations of refinements. So again, I suppose that this should
be good enough for everyone who is familiar with the hardware. And of
course I'm open to the constructive suggestions, the debugging aid is
not an ABI and could be changed/improved at any time.

You're suggesting to break down the debugging into several smaller
pieces, but I'm finding that as not a constructive suggestion because
the information about the full hardware state is actually necessary for
the productive debugging.
