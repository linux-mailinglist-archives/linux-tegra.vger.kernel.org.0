I'm not sure what else reasonable could be done without upgrading to a
very specific version of firmware, which definitely isn't a variant for
older devices which have a wild variety of bootloaders, customized
use-cases and etc.

We could add a kludge that I'm suggesting as a universal fallback
solution, it should work well for all cases that I care about.

So we could have the variant with identity mappings, and if mapping
isn't provided, then fall back to the kludge.
