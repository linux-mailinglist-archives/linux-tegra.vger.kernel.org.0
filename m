That was kind of the point of this experiment. When I started on this I
ran into the case where I was running out of predefined CMA areas and as
I went looking for ways on how to fix this, I realized that there's not
much reason to keep a global list of these areas. And even less reason
to limit the number of CMA areas to this predefined list. Very little
code outside of the core CMA code even uses this.

There's one instance of cma_for_each_area() that I don't grok. There's
another early MMU fixup for CMA areas in 32-bit ARM that. Other than
that there's a few places where the total CMA page count is shown for
informational purposes and I don't know how useful that really is
because totalcma_pages doesn't really track how many pages are used for
CMA, but pages that could potentially be used for CMA.

And that's about it.

It seems like there are cases where we might really need to globally
know about some of these areas, specifically ones that are allocated
very early during boot and then used for very specific purposes.

However, it seems to me like CMA is more universally useful than just
for these cases and I don't see the usefulness of tracking these more
generic uses.

If it's really useful to be able to access all CMA areas, then we could
easily just add them all to a global linked list upon activation (we may
still want/need to keep the predefined list around for all those early
allocation cases). That way we'd get the best of both worlds.

Well, I did run out of CMA areas during the early VPR testing because I
was initially testing with 16 areas and a different allocation scheme
that turned out to cause too many resizes in common cases.

However, given that the default is 8 on normal systems (20 on NUMA) and
is configurable, it means that even with restricting this to 4 for VPR
doesn't always guarantee that all 4 are available. Again, yes, we could
keep bumping that number, but why not turn this into something a bit
more robust where nobody has to know or care about how many there are?

I was referring to just totalcma_pages that isn't impacted by these
dynamically allocated regions. This is, again, because I don't see why
that information would be useful. It's a fairly easy change to update
that value, so if people prefer that, I can add that.

I don't see an immediate connection between totalcma_pages and
init_cma_reserved_pageblock(). I thought the latter was primarily useful
for making sure that the CMA pages can be migrated, which is still
critical for this use-case.
