I made them optional because, the number and type of supplies typically depend on the
kind of slot the controller is owning. If it is a CEM slot, then, it needs 3.3V & 12V
supplies and if it is an M.2 Key-E/M slot, it needs only 3.3V supply. Also, if there are
on-board PCIe endpoint devices, supplies may vary again from vendor to vendor.
Considering all these, I made them optional instead of mandatory.
Also, I agree that regulator framework supplies a dummy regulator if we make them mandatory
but doesn't supply one, but it does so with a warning print in the log which I feel is
an unwanted alert and to avoid that one has to supply dummy/fixed regulators which again
seems an overkill when all of this can be addressed by making slot regulators optional.
