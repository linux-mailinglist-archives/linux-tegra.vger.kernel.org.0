A while ago I had proposed adding memory-region*s* as an alternative
name for memory-region to make the naming more consistent with other
types of properties (think clocks, resets, gpios, ...). If we added
that, we could easily differentiate between the "legacy" cases where
no #memory-region-cells was allowed and the new cases where it was.

It's true that updating the property gets a bit complicated, but it's
not exactly rocket science. We really just need to splice the array. I
have a working implemention for this in U-Boot.

For what it's worth, we could run into the same issue with any new
property that we add. Even if we renamed this to iommu-memory-region,
it's still possible that a bootloader may have to update this property
if it already exists (it could be hard-coded in DT, or it could have
been added by some earlier bootloader or firmware).

I'm afraid that down the road we'll end up with other cases and then we
might proliferate a number of *-memory-region properties with varying
prefixes.

I am aware of one other case where we might need something like this: on
some Tegra SoCs we have audio processors that will access memory buffers
using a DMA engine. These processors are booted from early firmware
using firmware from system memory. In order to avoid trashing the
firmware, we need to reserve memory. We can do this using reserved
memory nodes. However, the audio DMA engine also uses the SMMU, so we
need to make sure that the firmware memory is marked as reserved within
the SMMU. This is similar to the identity mapping case, but not exactly
the same. Instead of creating a 1:1 mapping, we just want that IOVA
region to be reserved (i.e. IOMMU_RESV_RESERVED instead of
IOMMU_RESV_DIRECT{,_RELAXABLE}).

That would also fall into the IOMMU domain, but we can't reuse the
iommu-memory-region property for that because then we don't have enough
information to decide which type of reservation we need.

We could obviously make iommu-memory-region take a specifier, but we
could just as well use memory-regions in that case since we have
something more generic anyway.

With the #memory-region-cells proposal, we can easily extend the cell in
the specifier with an additional MEMORY_REGION_IOMMU_RESERVE flag to
take that other use case into account. If we than also change to the new
memory-regions property name, we avoid the ABI issue (and we gain a bit
of consistency while at it).
