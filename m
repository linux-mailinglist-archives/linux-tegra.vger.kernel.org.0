I missed that part... what other series are needed for this one? Except
Dmitry's power management set I do not have anything in my sight for
Tegras memory controllers.

Anyway, I can take the memory bits and provide a stable tag with these.
Recently there was quite a lot work around Tegra memory controllers, so
this makes especially sense if new patches appear.
