The other way round.
We may have sugov kthread of cluster [6,7] affined to CPU1. Is it
guaranteed that we cannot offline CPU1 (while CPU6 or CPU7 are still
online)?
Or without the affinity:
cluster [6,7] with isolcpu=6 (i.e. sugov kthread of that cluster can
only run on CPU7). Is offlining of CPU6 then prevented (as long as
CPU7 is online)?
I don't see how.
Anyway we probably want to change isolcpu and affinity to merely be 
a suggestion for the sugov DL case. Fundamentally it belongs to what
is run on that CPU anyway.
