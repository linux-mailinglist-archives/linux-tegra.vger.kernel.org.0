Not intentional, I'll add another message.

There are two possible variants here:

1. Device is suspended
2. Device is active

If device is suspended, then it will be activated on RPM-resume and h/w
state will require a specific performance state when resumed. Hence only
the the rpm_pstate should be set, otherwise SoC may start to consume
extra power if device won't be resumed by a consumer driver and
performance state is bumped without a real need.

If device is known to be active, then the performance state should be
updated immediately, otherwise we have inconsistent state with hardware.

For Tegra dev_suspended=true because in general it should be safe to
assume that hardware is suspended since it's either stopped by the PD
driver on initial power_on or it's assumed to be disabled by a consumer
driver during probe. Technically it's possible to check clock and reset
state of an attached device from the get_performance_state() to find the
real state of device, but it's not necessary to do so far.

I'll add comment to the code.

To be honest, I'm now confused by
of_get_required_opp_performance_state(). It assumes that device is
active all the time while attached and that device is stopped on detach.

If hardware is always-on, then it should be wrong to drop the
performance state on detach.

If hardware isn't always-on, then it might be suspended during
attachment, and thus, only the rpm_pstate should be set. It's also not
guaranteed that consumer driver will suspend device on unbind, leaving
it active on detach, thus it should be wrong to drop performance state
on detach.

Hence I think the default_pstate is a bit out of touch. If this
attach/detach behaviour is specific to QCOM driver/hardware, then maybe
of_get_required_opp_performance_state() should be moved out to a
get_performance_state() of the QCOM PD driver?

I added Rajendra Nayak to explain.

For now we're bailing out if default_pstate is set because it conflicts
with get_performance_state().

But we can factor out the code into a separate function anyways to make
it cleaner a tad.
