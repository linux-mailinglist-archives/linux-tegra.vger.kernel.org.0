Yes this is working as expected. The problem is that the ->power_on
callback for a device is occurring before the provider itself has been
resumed.

The provider in this case is an embedded controller, the BPMP, and it
needs to be resumed [0] prior to calling the provider callbacks. I am
wondering if any other providers have this requirement?
