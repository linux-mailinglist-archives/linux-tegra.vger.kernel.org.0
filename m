If it works then sure, that seems sensible.

This is the sort of setup that'd be a lot happier using a component
model.

This doesn't strike me as something that's likely to be robust but given
that that applies to DPCM in general so long as it doesn't break anyone
else's existing stuff I guess it should be viable, it's not like there
are actually good options that you could use currently.  It's really
hard to get enthusiastic about it though.

This is more in line with components so will probably be easier going
forwards.

Not sure anyone has ever done this with DPCM, could be wrong though.

In general most systems would be happier with components but yeah, I
think that's particularly the case for something as powerful and
flexible as your hardware seems to be.
