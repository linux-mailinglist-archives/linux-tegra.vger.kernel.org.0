Right, see below.

Definitely; we don't want quirks for endpoints (unless they're
actually broken) or for platforms (unless there's a platform hardware
or firmware defect).

There's no question that we need to delay and handle CRS after
power-on from D3cold.  I'm trying to get at the point that PCI itself
doesn't tell us how to do that power-on.  The mechanisms defined by
PCI rely on config space, which is only accessible in D0-D3hot, not
D3cold.  Power-on from D3cold can only happen via ACPI methods or
other platform-specific mechanisms, and the current design abstracts
those via platform_pci_set_power_state().  This is partly based on
Rafael's response in [1].

Yep, I think that's the right point.  I'm trying to figure out how to
integrate it.  Rafael suggests that delays may be platform-specific
and should be in platform_pci_set_power_state(), but the CRS handling
itself isn't platform-specific and maybe could be higher up.

I'm fishing to see if Tegra has some kind of power control for
endpoints that is not related to the platform_pci_*() framework.  How
did the endpoint get put in D3cold in the first place?  I assume
something in the suspend path did that?  Maybe this happens when we
suspend the Tegra RC itself, e.g., tegra_pcie_pm_suspend()?

  tegra_pcie_pm_suspend
    tegra_pcie_phy_power_off
    tegra_pcie_power_off

  tegra_pcie_pm_resume
    tegra_pcie_power_on
    tegra_pcie_phy_power_on

If a path like tegra_pcie_pm_resume() is causing the D3cold -> D0
transition for the endpoint, I don't think we want to do CRS handling
there because that path shouldn't be touching the endpoint.  But maybe
it should be doing the delays required by PCIe r5.0, sec 6.6.1, before
any config accesses are issued to devices.
