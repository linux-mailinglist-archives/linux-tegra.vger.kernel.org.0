The vast majority of this is a duplication of the host mode device tree
bindings. I think it'd be best to combine both and only highlight where
both modes differ.

The designware-pcie.txt binding does something similar.

The device tree snippets that you added have "nvidia,tegra194-pcie-ep"
for EP mode controllers. So either this is wrong or the DTS files are
wrong.

This device tree binding describes the exact same hardware, so I don't
think we necessarily need two different compatible strings. It's fairly
easy to distinguish between which mode to run in by looking at which
properties exist. EP mode for example is the only one that uses the
"addr_space" reg entry.

Rob, do you know why a different compatible string was chosen for the EP
mode? Looking at the driver, there are only a handful of differences in
the programming, but most of the driver remains identical. An extra DT
compatible string seems a bit exaggerated since it suggests that this is
actually different hardware, where it clearly isn't.

Why is this NVIDIA specific? Do other instantiations of the DW IP not
also need a means to define which GPIO is the reset?

This seems very brittle to me. There's no good way how we can detect
such misconfigurations. If instead we only have one node describing the
hardware fully, the chances of configuring things wrong (by for example
enabling both the host and EP mode device tree nodes) can be reduced.

So I think instead of duplicating all of the device tree content to have
both a host and an EP node for each controller, it'd be better to just
have a single node and let the device tree bindings specify which
changes to apply to switch into EP mode.

For example, there should be nothing wrong with specifying some of the
EP-only properties (like num-ib-windows and num-ob-windows) all the time
and only use them when we actually run in EP mode.

As I mentioned earlier, there are a couple of easy ways to distinguish
the modes. The presence of the "addr_space" reg entry is one example,
but we could also key off the nvidia,pex-rst-gpio property, since that
(presumably) wouldn't be needed for host mode.

That way we can just add default, host mode entries to tegra194.dtsi and
whenever somebody wants to enable EP mode, they can just override the
node in the board-level DTS file, like so:

	pcie@141a0000 {
		reg =3D <0x00 0x141a0000 0x0 0x00020000   /* appl registers (128K)      */
		       0x00 0x3a040000 0x0 0x00040000   /* iATU_DMA reg space (256K)  */
		       0x00 0x3a080000 0x0 0x00040000   /* DBI reg space (256K)       */

		reg-names =3D "appl", "atu_dma", "dbi", "addr_space";

		nvidia,pex-rst-gpio =3D <&gpio TEGRA194_MAIN_GPIO(GG, 1) GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
