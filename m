I tend to agree on mapping partitions only if they exist. So far I could
only find one exception. It is arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-370.dtsi which is
using the top level pool as well as a partition to reserve 32 bytes at the
bottom of sram. This can be fixed along with the sram driver change, by
adding another partition for the rest of the sram and using its handle in
the crypto@90000 instead of top-level sram node handle. Do you see anymore
exceptions where both top level pool and the partitions both are being used?

Then on the backward compatibility topic, another issue is that boot code
could add sram nodes dynamically. For example arch/arm/mach-k3/common.c in
u-boot does it. This particular case will not break after the suggested change
because it is not adding any partitions. However, there could be other
boot-loaders which are not this lucky.
