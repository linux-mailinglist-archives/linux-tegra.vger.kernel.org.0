The diff between "for-5.5/arm/dt" and "for-next" is quite small, you
only need to try to revert one or two patches. Seems the only major
change which could be somehow related to CPUFreq is that
"for-5.5/arm/dt" doesn't have regulators coupling support, but I don't
see how it could cause any effect since CPUFreq just doesn't load due to
a missing setup of supported_hw.

Unfortunately for now I can't reproduce the hang with a similar setup
that has OPPs in DT, doesn't have Tegra CPUFreq driver, doesn't
blacklist Tegra in cpufreq-dt-platdev.c and doesn't have regulators
coupling. I see the warning splats on boot and everything appears to be
working fine.

It's likely that the hang is caused by something else than this patch.
It's also a bit odd that you're accusing this patch while apparently it
worked a day before.

Please give a try to the recent upstream linux-next. If it works, then
probably there is nothing to worry about.

I'll factor out the blacklisting change and add it as a separate patch
into the next revision of the series, marking the patch as "fixes" and
"stable" in order to get rid of the warning on stable kernels.

I'm also fine with reverting of the DT changes for now, if you prefer
that. But again, this DT change shouldn't cause any critical problems.

I need a detailed report or a way to reproduce the problem in order to
solve it, please try to collect some more details. Try to compile the
cpufreq-dt driver as a loadable module, enable tracing of clk and
regulator events (tp_printk
trace_event=regulator_set_voltage,clk_set_rate,clk_set_parent).
