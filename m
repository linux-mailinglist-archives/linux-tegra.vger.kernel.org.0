Hej,

I'm working on the display controller for Apple silicon SoCs and will 
add some comments with support for it in mind.

If experimented with both proposed bindings for dcp and I think this 
binding is easer to understand and to work with.

dcp on Apple silicon will not use identity mappings. The IOMMU supports 
identity mapping but the pre-configured mappings setup by Apple's system 
firmware will not work with identity mapping. It maps multiple regions 
which are incompatible with a linear identity mapping. In addition the 
embbeded aarch64 micro controllers used in the display subsystem appears 
to use a heap mapped at low IOVA space starting at 0.

The binding supports mapping the same region to multiple devices. The 
code supports that and it will be used on Apple silicon. Not necessary 
to extend and complicate the example for I wanted to mention it 
explicitly.

The binding itself is sufficient for the needs of the display subsystem 
on Apple silicon. The device tree parsing code for reserved regions is 
of limited use in it's current form. We will have either to extend or 
duplicate it to retrieve the non-identity mappings. That's our problem 
to solve.
