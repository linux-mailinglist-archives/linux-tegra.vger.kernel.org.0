I suppose one way to overcome that would be to make it an error to write
"on" to the "control" files for these devices.

Currently doing this is likely going to break display support on Tegra,
so this would be a good idea in this case anyway.

Again, I could avoid all of these issues by avoiding runtime PM in this
driver, but I would end up reimplementing some of the same concepts. I'd
rather use something that's supported by the PM core and that might be
useful to other drivers than reinvent the wheel.
