Hello, thank you for your feedback.

You are correct, it is possible to simply read a register to obtain
this information, and this property is not needed.

I have only recently started digging in the DRM/KMS subsystem, could
you point out what those mechanisms are? That end goal seems like
something worth pursuing.

Regarding the placement of the workaround, I placed it in encoder_enable()
since my attempts of placing it in other functions (such as the connector's
->reset() method) resulted in a kernel hang, and I have no solution for this.
I'm assuming this is due to some part of the DSI hardware not being fully
initialized, but I haven't been able to confirm this.

Best regards,

Diogo
