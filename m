That message makes it appear as if it did find the backup GPT? But
presumably it didn't actually do so, since an all-zeroes UUID isn't
likely correct.

Does this device even have any GPT? IIRC some of the earlier Tegra
systems *only* had a TegraPT, and not any valid GPT. Perhaps that we
Tegra20 or earlier, and we'd fixed that by Tegra30? Or perhaps this
issue only applied to the eMMC boot HW partitions/region, not the main
data region.
