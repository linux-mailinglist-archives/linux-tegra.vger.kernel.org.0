I would appreciate this. We have the same situation on some of the NXP
i.MX8 SoCs right now: all the MMIO is addressable with 32bit, so all
the busses have a single address and size cell right now, but we would
need to extend the address-cells to 64bit just to properly describe the
DMA addressing capabilities of the devices.
