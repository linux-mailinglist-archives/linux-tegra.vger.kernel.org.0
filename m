I don't think this is true because in the case of a discrete RTC, its
interrupt pin can be connected directly to a PMIC to power up a board
instead of being connected to the SoC. In that case we don't have an
interrupt property but the RTC is still a wakeup source. This is the
usual use case for wakeup-source in the RTC subsystem. Else, if there is
an interrupt, then we assume the RTC is a wakeup source and there is no
need to have the wakeup-source property.
