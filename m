It should be compatible. nvhost_syncpt_wait_timeout_ext is essentially 
the same as host1x_syncpt_wait.

This is correct.

Looks like it is only calling _incr in timeout situations. So if VI gets 
stuck, the driver does the increment. (I don't know if that's the best 
way to handle timeouts, but it's a way)

I would expect the general use of syncpoints to work for Tegra20 as 
well, but you might want to do something simpler as well.

Sorry, it was just a general suggestion; I'm not very familiar with VI 
in general and Tegra20 VI not at all.

I would not expect it to be a problem although I don't know why it would 
be necessary to deviate from what upstream sets for host1x by default. 
VI clock (and possible other camera-related clocks) may be more precise 
though.

This field seems to correspond to various output frame formats. 3 seems 
to match YUV422 interleaved and 6 YUV420 planar, so I think that is 
working as expected.
