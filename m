I guess for the channel_map we can drop the offset/length, I just think 
it's fairly obvious that an IOMMU mapping API lets you specify from 
where and how much you want to map. Sure, it's not a functionality 
blocker as it can simply be implemented in userspace by shifting the 
reloc offset / IOVA equivalently, but it will reduce IO address space 
usage and prevent access to memory that was not intended to be mapped to 
the engine. The latter becomes a major PITA if you need to create safety 
documentation at this level -- don't know if this is relevant on Linux 
or not..

I am well aware of that. I'm not saying that we should copy the 
downstream stack. I am saying that when designing an ABI, we should 
consider all information available on what kind of features would be 
required from it.

Going through the proposed TegraDRM UAPI, there are some features that 
would probably not be immediately used by userspace, or supported in a 
non-NOOP fashion by the kernel:
* Map offset/length
* IOVA of mapping
* Creation of sync_file postfence
* Waiting for sync_file prefences
* SUBMIT_CONTEXT_SETUP flag
* Having two syncpt_incrs
* Reservations?

I suppose we can remove all of that for now, as long as we ensure that 
there is a path to add them back. I'm just a bit concerned that we'll 
end up with 10 different ABI revisions and userspace will have to do a 
version detection dance and enable things depending on driver version.

Anything else to remove?

Regarding things like explicit channel_map, sure, we could map things 
implicitly at submit time, but it is a huge performance improvement on 
newer chips, at least. So technically userspace doesn't need it, but 
going by that argument, we can get rid of a lot of kernel functionality 
-- after all, it's only needed if you want your hardware to perform well.

I'm hoping that porting the userspace won't take that long. It shouldn't 
be that big of a hurdle.

Considering that many products were successfully shipped without 
software-based scheduling, I wouldn't consider it "needed".

If it is known to deadlock, we should fix it. In any case, which kind of 
scheduler is used shouldn't affect the ABI, and we already have a 
functional implemention in the Host1x driver, so we should merge the ABI 
first rather than wait for another year while the rest of the driver is 
redesigned and rewritten.
