There is a delay in the runtime_d3cold case, see __pci_start_power_transition().

But overall platform_pci_power_manageable() only checks whether or not the
platform firmware can change the power state of the device.  If it can, it
is expected to take care of any necessary delays while doing that (because
there may be delays required by this particular instance of the platform
firmware, beyond what is mandated by the PCI spec, or there may not be any
need to wait at all).  If the platform firmware becomes responsible for
setting the device's power state, there is not reason why it should not be
responsible for the delay part too.

In any case, I'm not sure how useful it is to add delays for everyone in the
cases in which a specific system needs a delay because of its own PM
implementation limitations.  It may be better to quirk such systems explicitly
as long as there are not too many quirks in there, or we'll end up adding more
and more *implicit* quirks in the form of general delays.

Cheers!
