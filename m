That's really a question of how you define suspension. In the case of
display drivers we have the somewhat unfortunate situation that in most
SoCs the display "device" is actually represented by a collection of
different devices. On Tegra specifically, for example, you have a couple
of display controllers, then some "encoders" that take pixel streams
=66rom the display controllers and encode them into some wire format like
LVDS, HDMI, DSI or DP.

Prohibiting suspension of any of the individual devices causes problems
because it effectively makes the whole composite display device not
suspendable. Doing so in turn usually means that you can't change the
display configuration anymore because devices need to be powered up and
down in order to change the configuration.

I consider powering up and down the devices a form of suspension. Hence
it seemed natural to implement using runtime PM.

It sounds to me like userspace preventing runtime PM is problematic in
most scenarios that involve composite devices because it makes all of
the interactions between the devices a bit complicated.

Well, runtime PM is very convenient for this, though. It would allow the
same code paths to be used in all cases.
