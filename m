For now this IOCTL isn't useful from a userspace perspective of older
SoCs and I'll need to add a lot of code that won't do anything useful
just to conform to the specific needs of the newer SoCs. Trying to unify
everything into a single API doesn't sound like a good idea at this
point and I already suggested to Mikko to try out variant with a
separated per-SoC code paths in the next version, then the mappings
could be handled separately by the T186+ paths.
