Okay, then jiffies can't be used here because this function is used for
the coupled / power-gated state only. All CPUs are idling in this state.

Since all CPUs are idling here, the locking isn't a problem.

The wait_for_secondary_cpu_parking() function is called on CPU0, it
waits for the secondary CPUs to enter into safe-state before CPU0 could
power-gate the whole CPU cluster.

Yes, my point is that udelay() doesn't bring much benefit for us here
because:

1. we want to enter into power-gated state as quick as possible and
udelay() just adds an unnecessary delay

2. udelay() spins in a busy-loop until delay is expired, just like we're
doing it in this function already
