I don't see DRM driver being loaded at all and no errors related to it
in the log. This means that likely some of the DRM sub-drivers is stuck
in deferred probe.

Guillaume, could you please show contents of
/sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred ?

These messages also don't look good:

tegra-xusb-padctl 7009f000.padctl: failed to setup XUSB ports: -22
tegra-xusb-padctl: probe of 7009f000.padctl failed with error -22

I don't have T124 and all these problems should be specific to the T124
platform. Somebody with a direct access to hardware should look into it.
