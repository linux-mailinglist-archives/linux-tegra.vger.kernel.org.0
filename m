One advantage of having both MC and EMC as ICC providers is that there
won't be a need to mess with a custom coupling of MC-EMC drivers
together because interconnect API naturally takes care of the coupling
for us by telling ICC users to defer until both providers are registered.

I'll take another look at this over the weekend, but for now my v1
variant looks appropriate in terms of a better hardware description and
implementation in the code.
