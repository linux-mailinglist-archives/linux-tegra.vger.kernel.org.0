Well, it does use devm_request_irq() so the handler should be 
unregistered by devres *after* ->remove has finished, however that does 
still leave a potential race window in which a pending IRQ could be 
taken during the later part of rockchip_pcie_remove() after it has 
started turning off critical things. Unless the clocks and regulators 
can also be delegated to devres, it might be more robust to explicitly 
manage the IRQs as well. Mixing the two schemes can be problematic when 
the exact order of both setup and teardown matters.
