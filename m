If people have real technical reasons for needing unmatched stream 
bypass, then we'll probably need to consider some sort of per-SMMU 
override anyway, since well-meaning users rendering the system unusable 
by enabling a security option isn't ideal. I'm in the middle of a big 
rework to accommodate platform-specific extensions more easily, so 
that's certainly an angle I can try to plan for.

On the other hand, if it's merely that nobody's yet got round to filling 
out the DT properly, then AIUI that's pretty much exactly what Doug 
wanted to motivate, so that the option *can* be used more widely by 
users who might want it. Hence the provocative title :)

Robin.
