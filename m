That's kind of expected. At one point this was working mostly reliably
but given that there's been very limited testing, it's not a surprise
that this is somewhat defunct.

One thing to know, though, is that the Nouveau X11 driver won't do you
any good. The way that it works on Tegra is that the GPU is used only to
render to offscreen surfaces and the Tegra DRM/KMS driver will then scan
those buffers out to your display (via X's modesetting driver). In order
for this to work you need to enable the Nouveau and Tegra drivers in
Mesa and then they should be able to work together if you've got an up-
to-date X server. You might also need a bit of luck.

Unfortunately L4T doesn't work with any of this. Both the display and
GPU drivers are completely different things in L4T vs. upstream Linux. I
suppose you could try and port those drivers to a more recent kernel,
but I can't recommend it.

The plan was to get upstream mostly to feature parity with L4T so that
it could serve as a long-term option for people after official software
support was dropped. We managed to do a bunch of things, but there are
certain aspects that aren't quite as polished as I wanted. Hardware
accelerated multimedia is among those. You can probably get some of it
working using the V4L2 Tegra VDE driver. GPU acceleration is another,
somewhat unfinished bit. Again, an up-to-date Mesa and X server should
get you there most of the way, but it's not been tested for a while, so
may have regressed.

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Yeah, it's a bit unfortunate, but you'll probably want some custom
kernel image anyway for this particular use-case. Things are much more
standardized on 64-bit ARM nowadays, but 32-bit ARM had some wild west,
shoot-from-the-hip vibes. =3D)

Yeah, if it's an always-on regulator you can usually ignore those
warnings. It's always good to describe them and that'll get rid of the
warnings, but it shouldn't be necessary.

What kinds of warning were related to deferred probe? Normally the
related messages are debug level, so unless you've enabled those (which
is probably a good idea for what you're doing) you shouldn't be seeing
those.

You could always try to see if you can prevent XHCI from being
suspended. Not sure if there's a standard way to do it, but worst case
you could try commenting out the code that does it, see if that gets you
anywhere. It'll probably still break at some point when interrupts get
disabled and such. Or it may break earlier since the USB subsystem is
probably not designed to stay up until that late.

Again, it might be better to check with a developer friendly device what
the status is with suspend/resume on Tegra124 in general. I think the
tests that we run periodically would've flagged any generic suspend and
resume issue, so it might be something specific to Nyan (possibly
display?). Have you tried poking the device in different ways after the
resume? Does it react at all? Does a network ping perhaps work? I could
also be that the system wake isn't properly hooked up or something. One
thing worth trying would be to use the RTC to wake the system up from
suspend. I think that's what we use in the daily testing. rtcwake is the
tool that you want to look into for that.
