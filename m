Also i915 will run into trouble with attach. In particular since i915 
starts a full ww transaction in its attach callback to be able to lock 
other objects if migration is needed. I think i915 CI would catch this 
in a selftest.

Perhaps it's worthwile to take a step back and figure out, if the 
importer is required to lock, which callbacks might need a ww acquire 
context?

(And off-topic, Since we do a lot of fancy stuff under dma-resv locks 
including waiting for fences and other locks, IMO taking these locks 
uninterruptible should ring a warning bell)
