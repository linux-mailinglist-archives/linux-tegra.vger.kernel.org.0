dma_set_max_seg_size() does indeed instruct the iommu drivers about
the merging capabilities (btw, swiotlb should be able to implement
this kind of merging as well, but that is a different discussion).

But the problem is that you don't just change the dma_set_max_seg_size,
but also the block layer max segment size setting, which is used for
block layer merges.  And we don't have the accounting for the first and
last segment in a request (those that are being merged to), so if you
enable the virt_boundary segments can grow to a size only limited by the
maximum request size.  We could add that accounting with a bit of
work, it's just that for devices that typicall use the virt boundary
there is no point (their actually segment is a page and not related
to the Linux "segment").
