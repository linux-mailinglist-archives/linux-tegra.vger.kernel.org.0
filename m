There no SoCs currently than need to differentiate between multiple
BPMPs, so yes, it would be possible to look up the node by compatible.
But we also used to assume that PCs would only ever come with a single
GPU or audio card and that's always caused a lot of work to clean up
when it turned out to no longer be true.

Also, we already have a couple of devices referencing the BPMP by
phandle like this, so having this in a CCPLEX node would keep things
consistent.

One of the reasons why we initially did it this way was also so that we
could make the dependencies explicit within device tree. If we look up
by compatible string, then the driver is the only one with the knowledge
about where to get at it. If we have the explicit reference we at least
have a chance of determining the dependency by just looking at the
device tree.

I don't expect there would be many. I think there's an earlier
generation of Tegra that requires a regulator and I can imagine that's
pretty common. But other than that I would expect this to be a fairly
narrow set of properties.

That's only if you absolutely want to stick with the "one driver per
subsystem" model. I personally think that's completely obsolete these
days. If you have a CPU complex device that can do both CPU frequency
scaling and put the CPU into idle states, for example, then there is
really no reason to artificially split that into two separate drivers
just to match the subsystems that we have.

Most subsystems that I've come across work just fine if a single driver
registers with multiple subsystems.

I also know that some people like it better when things are nicely split
up into multiple drivers. But I really don't see how that simplifies
things. In fact in my opinion that makes things only more complicated
because you have additional boilerplate and then you need to be extra
careful about how these different drivers are ordered, and you need to
take extra precautions when sharing things like clocks and register
regions.

That sounds like it would get very complicated for something this
simple. Having a compatible string in /cpus seemed like the most logical
option because it would basically just work out of the box and the same
way we're used to from other devices.
