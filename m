I had the same feeling when I took a look at the patch, but later
changed mind, since the error will pop up also if a system has an
unmatured BIOS with some bogus vendor DMI string, too.  That is, users
of such a machine gets always an error message although this isn't any
serious problem unless you need a dedicated UCM profile (which can't
be used on such a system in anyway).

So, I agree that exporting dmi_avilable could improve the situation a
bit, but the error level needs still reconsideration.
