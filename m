Ok. This is kind of opposite to what I am doing on the Qcom platform I 
am working on. The h/w throttling is the default since like you 
mentioned it is more reactive. And s/w does only critical trip management.

Yes. So the first two steps you mentioned is exactly what 
cpufreq_cooling.c also does except for the fact that it is a s/w 
mitigation. Now if you have two sources that is updating the max 
frequency via qos, I think you can do either of the following before
calculating thermal pressure
1. Read the throttled frequency from h/w if  your h/w supports this feature.
	or
2. Use freq_qos_read_value to get the max frequency value.

Either way only the correct throttled capacity should be passed to 
scheduler.
