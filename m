Not very convincing to me. I don't see a "plenty of other drivers",
there is only one arm-smmu driver.

The dev_get_dev_node() is under CONFIG_ARM_SMMU_LEGACY_DT_BINDINGS (!).
Guys, doesn't it look strange to you? :)

The arm-smmu driver does a similar thing for the modern bindings to what
Nicolin's v3 is doing.

You don't need the global pointer if you have SMMU OF node.

You could also get driver pointer from mc->dev->driver.

But I don't think you need to do this at all. The probe_device() could
be invoked only for the tegra_smmu_ops and then seems you could use
dev_iommu_priv_set() in tegra_smmu_of_xlate(), like sun50i-iommu driver
does.
