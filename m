This was discussed some before. This is for the firmware/bootloader to
setup ECAM mode. Then the kernel will see generic (ACPI) ECAM.

Yes, it is iATU config, but so is 'config'. If we were starting over,
I'd say 'reg' should just have the entire address space for iATU and
the driver could figure out how to configure it (beyond what ranges
says). But that ship has sailed. Also, note that the address range
here is disjoint from 'config', so it looks like we'd need 2 entries
anyways.
