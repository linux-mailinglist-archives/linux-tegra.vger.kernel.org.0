H/w mitigation is additional and should be transparent to the software
mitigation. The software mitigation is much more flexible, but it has
latency. Software also could crash and hang.

Hardware mitigation doesn't have latency and it will continue to work
regardless of the software state.

The CCF driver is aware about the h/w cooling status [1], hence software
sees the actual frequency.

It allows userspace to check whether hardware cooling is active via the
cooling_device sysfs. Otherwise we don't have ability to check whether
h/w cooling is active, I think it's a useful information. It's also
interesting to see the cooling_device stats, showing how many times h/w
mitigation was active.

I wasn't aware about existence of the thermal pressure, thank you for
pointing at it. At a quick glance it should be possible to benefit from
the information about the additional pressure.

Seems the current thermal pressure API assumes that there is only one
user of the API. So it's impossible to aggregate the pressure from
different sources, like software cpufreq pressure + h/w freq pressure.
Correct? If yes, then please let me know yours thoughts about the best
approach of supporting the aggregation.

I'll factor out the h/w limiter from this patchset and prepare the v4.
Thank you all for taking a look at the patches.
