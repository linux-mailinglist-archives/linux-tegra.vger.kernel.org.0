You're spot on - it is/should be a generic property.

I believe that in general many panels were mounted in the correct
orientation so the property, kernel and userspace were slow to catch
up. In some cases panels will use flip x+y to denote 180 rotation, yet
lacking the rotation property.
The s6e8aa0 is an example of the last oddity. To make it better, the
two dts in-tree always set both flip x and y.

That's why I mentioned the rotation introduction or "confusion" if I
may. Skimming through the pre/post YAML device tree bindings and grep
through the panel themselves will greatly reduce the list.
In other words: if neither binding documentation/in-tree dts nor panel
mentions rotation - omit it.
