There are dozens variants of the panels and system could easily have
more than one panel, hence a direct lookup by phandle is a natural
choice for the panels.

While all Tegra SoCs have a single fixed MC in the system, and thus,
there is no real need to use phandle because we can't mix up MC with
anything else.

This is fine in general, but I'm afraid that in this particular case we
will need to have a fall back anyways because otherwise it should break
the old functionality.

So I don't think that using phandle for the MC device finding is really
warrant.

Phandle is kinda more applicable for the cases where only the DT node
lookup is needed (not the lookup of the MC device driver), but even then
it is also not mandatory.

I hope you agree.
