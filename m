My understanding after reading the PCIe specification is that CRS is a
mechanism that allows an endpoint to signal that it isn't ready yet for
operation after reset or power-on from D3cold. There's nothing in there
that's platform specific. This is really only for specific endpoints.

I don't see how adding platform specific PM code would help in this
case. At a platform level we don't know if users are going to plug in a
PCI endpoint that needs a long delay before it's ready after reset and/
or exit from D3cold.

I do understand that perhaps pci_device_is_present() is perhaps not the
best place to do complex CRS handling, but if a mechanism is clearly
described in the specification, isn't it something that should be dealt
with in the core? That way we don't have to quirk this for every device
and platform.

The PCIe specification says that:

	Software that intends to take advantage of this mechanism must
	ensure that the first access made to a device following a valid
	reset condition is a Configuration Read Request accessing both
	bytes of the Vendor ID field in the device's Configuration Space
	header.

So doesn't that mean that pci_device_is_present() is already much too
late because we've potentially made other configuration read requests in
the meantime?

Wouldn't it make more sense to push the CRS handling up a bit? The
existing pci_power_up() function seems like it would be a good place.
For example, adding code to deal with CRS right after the platform PCI
PM calls but before pci_raw_set_power_state() seems like it would fit
the restrictions given in the above quote from the specification.
