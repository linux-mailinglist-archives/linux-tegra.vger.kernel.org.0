That would be somewhat surprising, though. The IP used in Tegra must be
pretty close to the IP used in other SoCs, and the code that we need in
pex_ep_event_pex_rst_{assert,deassert}() is pretty significant. Why the
other instantiations wouldn't need something similar seems unlikely to
me.

Perhaps Jingoo or Gustavo can shed some light on this.
