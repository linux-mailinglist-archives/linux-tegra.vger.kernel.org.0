the idea was indeed to convert the driver to the i2c-slave sub-sys and add
the EC sub-functions (keyboard, mouse, power, ...) as children below the
controllers node, which are currently hard-coded. As this didn't happen 
yet these entries could be removed for now.
Using i2c instead of nvec as the node name also makes sense, because that
is the real hardware described by the following properties. On the other 
hand, I'm not sure if it is worth the effort (u-boot would also need this 
change).

Best regards,

Marc
