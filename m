The additional fields aren't problem for T20, which doesn't need most of
the fields. I'd try to go with the additional fields for now and see how
it will look like, if it will be bothering too much, then we may
consider to refactor the drivers more thoroughly (later on, in a
separate series), with a better/nicer separation and taking into account
a potential modularization support by the MC drivers.

Using a union for the exclusive fields also could work, although always
need to be extra careful with the unions.

But isn't tegra_mc already a superset of tegra186_mc? I think the
tegra186_mc_client is the main difference here.
