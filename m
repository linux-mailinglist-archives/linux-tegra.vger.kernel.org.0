Yeah, but it can not be directly related to the CPU because if the GPU
is intensively used and the battery is charging at the same time, the
skin temp will increase anyway.

You should set the trip points close to the functioning boundary
temperature given in the hardware specification whatever the resulting
heating effect is on the device.

The thermal zone is there to protect the silicon and the system from a
wild reboot.

If the Nexus 7 is too hot after the changes, then you may act on the
sources of the heat. For instance, set the the highest OPP to turbo or
remove it, or, if there is one, change the thermal daemon to reduce the
overall power consumption.
