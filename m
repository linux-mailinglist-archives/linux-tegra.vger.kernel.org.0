Yeah, I realised later last night that this probably originated from 
forking the whole driver downstream. But even then you could have 
treated the other one as a separate nsmmu with a single instance ;)

Since it does add a bit of confusion to the code and comments, let's 
just keep things simple. I do like Jon's suggestion of actually 
enforcing that the number of "reg" regions exactly matches the number 
expected for the given compatible - I guess for now that means just 
hard-coding 2 and hoping the hardware folks don't cook up any more of 
these...

Robin.
