Hi Mark & Kuninori,

For the HW I am using, there are no fixed endpoints and I am not sure if 
it is allowed to have empty endpoints in audio-graph-card. 
Crossbar/router provides the flexibility to connect the components in 
any required order. Patch [05/23] exposes required graph and MUX 
controls for the flexible configurations. Mostly, in DT, I am trying to 
model the component itself and finally router can help me specify the 
audio path to interconnect various components. Hence I was trying to 
understand if it is really necessary to represent the links using 
audio-graph-card. Kindly help me understand what more it offers. If 
simple-card works fine, are we allowed to use it?

Thank you,
Sameer.
