I have tried it on both a MacroSilicon HDMI capture card and an Arzopa 
Z1FC 1080p portable monitor and run into the same darker colors. Both 
have in common that they use HDMI which seems to line up with what Aaron 
is reporting. I do not have an eDP display to test or another carrier 
board with a different display out to test.

For reference, I am said person. I have a Jetson TX2 Devkit that uses 
the P2771 Device Tree. I'm running a Fedora distrokernel with no 
additional patches applied by myself. I have personally noticed the 
issue to at least be present on 6.14.5 and 6.17.4.


I'm currently not at home to take screenshots with and without the 
submitted patch, but will be able to do it tomorrownight or friday.


Kindest regards,


Jasper
