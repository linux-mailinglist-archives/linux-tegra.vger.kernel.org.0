Based on the json-schema test cases[1], it looks like the tool is
doing the right thing and our schemas are wrong.

It's a quick fixup in the tools though to just delete any
'additionalProperties: true':

index 3cc5e428b0eb..a0f22aab935a 100644
--- a/dtschema/lib.py
+++ b/dtschema/lib.py
@@ -367,6 +367,9 @@ def fixup_sub_schema(schema, is_prop):
     if not isinstance(schema, dict):
         return

+    if 'additionalProperties' in schema and
schema['additionalProperties'] == True:
+        schema.pop('additionalProperties', None)
+
     schema.pop('description', None)
     fixup_interrupts(schema)
     if is_prop:

I'm leaning towards this route besides being easy because the whole
reason for the explicit 'additionalProperties: true' was so that
missing 'additionalProperties' is flagged as an error. The only other
way I've come up with handling this is making common schema use a
different meta-schema.

The result with the above is about 150 warnings. I quickly got this
down to 100 with only a couple of fixes, but the rest appear to be
individual schemas...
