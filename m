Thanks Sameer. So, will keep mclk not enabled in clock driver but will=20
do mclk enable in asoc_utils_init and will remove machine startup and=20
shutdown.

mclk dependency with suspend/resume and I2S and audio clocks proper=20
handling in audio driver can be taken care separately out of this series.

Dimitry, I hope you too agree with this.
