I understand your point, but we don't need to call
dev_pm_opp_set_opp() from _set_required_opps() to accomplish this. In
fact, I have realized that calling dev_pm_opp_set_opp() from there
doesn't work the way we expected.

More precisely, at each recursive call to dev_pm_opp_set_opp() we are
changing the OPP for a genpd's OPP table for a device that has been
attached to it. The problem with this, is that we may have several
devices being attached to the same genpd, thus sharing the same
OPP-table that is being used for their required OPPs. So, we may have
several active requests for different OPPs for a genpd's OPP table
simultaneously. It seems wrong from the OPP library point of view. To
me, it's would be better to leave any kind of aggregation to be
managed by genpd itself.

For the reason explained above, it still looks correct to call
_set_opp_level() from _set_required_opps(), as $subject patch proposes
(but clarifications of why is certainly needed in the commit message).
Moreover, when/if we see a need for additonal resourses but the level,
to be managed through a genpd's OPP table, we can extend
_set_required_opps() to cover that too.

The API as such isn't the problem, but rather that we are recursivly
calling dev_pm_opp_set_opp() for the required-devs.

In the single PM domain case, this would simply not work, as there is
not a separate virtual device we can assign to the required-dev to.

Kind regards
