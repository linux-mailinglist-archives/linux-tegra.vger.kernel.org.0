Rob, Will, we're reaching the point where upstream has enough
functionality that this is becoming a critical issue for us.

E.g. Lenovo Yoga C630 is lacking this and a single dts patch to boot
mainline with display, GPU, WiFi and audio working and the story is
similar on several devboards.

As previously described, the only thing I want is the stream mapping
related to the display controller in place, either with the CB with
translation disabled or possibly with a way to specify the framebuffer
region (although this turns out to mess things up in the display
driver...)

I did pick this up again recently and concluded that by omitting the
streams for the USB controllers causes an instability issue seen on one
of the controller to disappear. So I would prefer if we somehow could
have a mechanism to only pick the display streams and the context
allocation for this.


Can you please share some pointers/insights/wishes for how we can
conclude on this subject?


PS. The list of devices specified
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/cover.1587407458.git.saiprakash.ranjan@codeaurora.org/
covers this need as well, if that matters...

Thanks,
Bjorn
