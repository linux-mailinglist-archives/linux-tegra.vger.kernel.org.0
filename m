As it turns out, next-20210210 is passing all the tests again so
it looks like this got fixed in the meantime:

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3210192
  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/results/3210192/0_igt-kms-tegra

And here's a more extensive list of IGT tests on next-20210211,
all the regressions have been fixed:

  https://kernelci.org/test/plan/id/60254c42f51df36be53abe62/


I haven't run a reversed bisection to find the fix, but I guess
it wouldn't be too hard to find out what happened by hand anyway.
I see the drm/tegra/for-5.12-rc1 tag has been merged into
linux-next, maybe that solved the issue?

FYI I've also run some jobs with your debug patch and with the
breaking patch reverted:

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3210245
  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3210596

Meanwhile I'll see what can be done to improve the automated
bisection so if there are new IGT regressions they would get
reported earlier.  I guess it would have saved us all some time
if it had been bisected in December.

Thanks,
Guillaume
