Here are more spec references that seem applicable:

  - PCIe r4.0, sec 7.7.1.2 (Message Control Register for MSI) says:

      MSI Enable – If Set and the MSI-X Enable bit in the MSI-X
      Message Control register (see Section 7.9.2) is Clear, the
      Function is permitted to use MSI to request service and is
      prohibited from using INTx interrupts.

  - PCIe r4.0, sec 7.7.2.2 (Message Control Register for MSI-X) says:

      MSI-X Enable – If Set and the MSI Enable bit in the MSI Message
      Control register (see Section 6.8.1.3) is Clear, the Function is
      permitted to use MSI-X to request service and is prohibited from
      using INTx interrupts (if implemented).

I read that to mean a device is prohibited from using MSI/MSI-X for
some interrupts and INTx for others.  Since Tegra194 cannot use
MSI/MSI-X for PME, it should use INTx for *all* interrupts.  That
makes the MSI/MSI-X Capabilities superfluous, and they should be
omitted.

If we set pdev->no_msi for Tegra194, we'll avoid MSI/MSI-X completely,
so we'll assume *all* interrupts including hotplug will be INTx.  Will
that work?
