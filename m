Perhaps we can instead change the reference counting such that if you 
close the GEM object, the mappings will be dropped as well automatically.

Negative. Like I have explained in previous discussions, with the 
current way the usage of hardware resources is much more deterministic 
and obvious. I disagree on the point that this is much more complicated 
for the userspace. Separating syncpoint and channel allocation is one of 
the primary motivations of this series for me.

Considering the issues with fileno limits, I suppose there is no other 
choice. Considering the recent NTSYNC proposal by Wine developers, maybe 
we should also have NTHANDLEs to get rid of restrictions of file 
descriptors. DRM syncobjs may have some advantages over sync files, but 
also disadvantages. They cannot be poll()ed, so they cannot be combined 
with waits for other resources.

I'll look into this for v6.

This may be doable, but I don't think it is critical for this UAPI, so 
let's consider it after this series.

The userspace should anyway not be able to assume the initial value of 
the syncpoint upon allocation. The kernel should set it to some high 
value to catch any issues related to wraparound.

Also, this makes code more complicated since it now needs to ensure all 
waits on the syncpoint have completed before freeing the syncpoint, 
which can be nontrivial e.g. if the waiter is in a different virtual 
machine or some other device connected via PCIe (a real usecase).

Let me check if I understood you correctly:
- You would like to have the job's cmdbuf have further GATHER opcodes 
that jump into smaller gathers?

I assume this is needed because currently WAITs are placed into the 
pushbuffer, so the job will take a lot of space in the pushbuffer if 
there are a lot of waits (and GATHERs in between these waits)?

If so, perhaps as a simpler alternative we could change the firewall to 
allow SETCLASS into HOST1X for waiting specifically, then userspace 
could just submit one big cmdbuf taking only little space in the 
pushbuffer? Although that would only allow direct ID/threshold waits.

In any case, it seems that this can be added in a later patch, so we 
should omit it from this series for simplicity. If it is impossible for 
the userspace to deal with it, we could disable the firewall 
temporarily, or implement the above change in the firewall.

Sure. I didn't do it this time since it's backwards compatible and it's 
easy to detect if the new UAPI is available by checking for /dev/host1x. 
I can bump it in v6 if necessary.

Looks like I accidentally placed some spaces into firewall.c. Otherwise 
the warnings it prints do not look critical.

Yes, that's true. Will take a look for v6.

Will take a look at these two for v6.
