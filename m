Yes, this should be correct.

Both write and read paths have the same direction in terms of
interconnect API. The source node requests bandwidth from the
destination node, where source is memory client and destination is EMC/EMEM.

It should be fine to define ICC ID for EMC that doesn't overlap with the
memory client IDs, say #1000.

I'll try to update this series to use ICC-path per display plane and see
how it goes.

In general, looks like should be fine to have ICC paths defined per
memory client.
