The patch

   ASoC: tegra-wm8903: Document new nvidia, headset property

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: tegra-wm8903: Document new nvidia, headset property

Some devices have a 4-pin headset jack instead of 3-pin microphone jack.
The new boolean nvidia,headset property tells that the Mic Jack represents
the state of a headset microphone. This additional hardware description is
needed because microphone detection procedure differs in a case of a 4-pin
jack from a 3-pin jack.
