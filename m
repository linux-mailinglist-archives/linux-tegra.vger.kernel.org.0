Personally I'm not a fan of the port service driver model.  It creates
additional struct devices for things that are not separate devices.
And it creates a parallel hierarchy in /sys/bus/pci_express/devices/
that I think does not accurately model the hardware.

The existing port services (AER, DPC, hotplug, etc) are things the
device advertises via the PCI Capabilities defined by the generic PCIe
spec, and in my opinion the support for them should be directly part
of the PCI core and activated when the relevant Capability is present.

The DMA engine is different -- this is device-specific functionality
and I think the obvious way to discover it and bind a driver to it is
via the PCI Vendor and Device ID.

This *is* complicated by the fact that you can't just use
pci_register_driver() to claim functionality implemented in Root Ports
or Switch Ports because portdrv binds to them before you have a
chance.  I think that's a defect in the portdrv design.  The usual
workaround is to use pci_get_device(), which has its own issues (it's
ugly, it's outside the normal driver binding model, doesn't work
nicely with hotplug or udev, doesn't coordinate with other drivers
using the same device, etc).  There are many examples of this in the
EDAC code.
