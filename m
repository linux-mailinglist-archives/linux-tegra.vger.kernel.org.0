Sorry for the delay.

First off, let me note that I have seen your most recent patches and
thanks for taking the feedback into account, much appreciated!

Nevertheless, I feel that I need to address the below, because it is
really important.

In general, yes.

However, if you talk about PM-runtime, there are definitions of
"suspended" and "active" in there already.  Namely, in the PM-runtime
context, "suspended" means "may not be accessible to software" whereas
"active" means "software can access it".

For PM-runtime, that shouldn't be a problem at all.

PM-runtime is all about (possibly) saving energy by powering down
devices that are not in use.  In particular, It is not about powering
down any devices on demand for any reason other than idleness.
Therefore in PM-runtime a situation in which a given device cannot be
suspended at all is regarded as normal, even though that may not be
desirable for energy-efficiency reasons.  It just means that the
device is in use by somebody all the time.  Moreover, PM-runtime is
designed to make it possible to resume devices at any time (as long as
the hardware works as expected), as soon as they are needed, modulo
some possible delays.  Actually, that's the purpose of a significant
part of the PM-runtime framework.

Accordingly, device drivers may refuse to suspend devices, but
refusing to resume a device is not expected by PM-runtime.

If writing "on" to the "control" file of a device does not cause it to
be resumed (if suspended) and to stay in the "active" meta-state until
"auto" is written to that file, you cannot really claim that
PM-runtime is working correctly on your system.

Unfortunately, that's not the case.

The purpose of PM-runtime is to allow idle devices to be put into
power states in which it may not be safe to access them and to make
them go back into the "accessible and responsive" state whenever
software wants/needs to access them in a coordinated fashion.  IOW, it
kind of is a counterpart of CPU idle time management.

Even so, that's how it works.

User space can expect to be able to block runtime suspend of devices
at any level of device hierarchy, at least for diagnostics if nothing
else, end the kernel is responsible for ensuring that.

The same low-level power-up and power-down code can be used in all
cases, but PM-runtime is not low-level enough.  It is also
opportunistic, so if you need to power down a device for reasons other
than "natural" idleness, PM-runtime is not the right tool for that
task.

Of course, PM-runtime callbacks can invoke the low-level power-up and
power-down code, but as you said there are reasons for powering down
devices not just because they happen to be idle.  System-wide suspend
is one of them.
