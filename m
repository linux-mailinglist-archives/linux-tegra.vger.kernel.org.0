That's what everyone else is doing, including Qualcomm which is
upstreaming multiple new SoCs per year, multiple patchsets, multiple
patches.

But no, I do not expect you to split it but I expect to use
get_maintainers.pl, unless that would cause a patchbomb cc-ing 50
addresses (I don't suggest that you created such patchbomb -
hypothetical). Removing maintainers from Cc list is not the way to solve
patchbomb problem, if such arises. Splitting a hypothetical patchbomb
would be the solution.

I explained in the beginning why someone could want to look:

1. It's a subsystem maintainer's patch, not yours.

2. Conflict in that file.

But regardless why someone would or would not want, get_maintainers.pl
asked you to Cc them.

Filtering means you don't use. Following this logic (although not
exactly "common sense" but writing bindings point you that common sense
for driver bindings is driver subsystem):
1. I use get_maintainers.pl on my patch.
2. Then I remove all addresses except linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org.
3. All good and I claim I am using get_maintainers.pl.

No, they were not sent to the right people at the time. The right people
at the time are pointed by get_maintainers.pl which you filtered out.

Look again, this is the v1:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260223143305.3771383-7-thierry.reding@kernel.org/

Where is any phy maintainer or the phy mailing list Cc-ed?

Instead of again using "baseless" arguments, please provide the actual
fact for that claim that you cc-ed right list and right people on that
patch.

> resent them, to the DT maintainers only, to give you guys a chance to

This is not a resent, this is the v1. Do you see "RESEND" in the
subject? I don't.

I am pointing out the facts now. If you disagree, please point me to the
original posting of phy patch with the 'right' people in CC list, as
requested by get_maintainers.pl.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
