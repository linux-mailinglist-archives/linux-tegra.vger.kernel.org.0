Well, it couldn't really be a direct mapping anyway. In general I don't 
think that combination makes any sense, since the presence of 
"iommu-addresses" means one of two things; either it says the IOVA range 
is carved out for some special purpose or just unusable, in which case 
allocating any memory to back it would surely be pointless, or it's 
saying don't touch these addresses because the device is already 
accessing them, thus the underlying physical memory must be allocated 
somewhere already.

Thanks,
Robin.
