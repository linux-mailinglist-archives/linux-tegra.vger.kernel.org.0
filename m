Hi Sowjanya,

Sorry for the delayed response. I am still in vacation ðŸ˜‰

If that is the case I wouldn't term this as PSCI compliant firmware and
wouldn't attempt to use PSCI CPU idle driver. Now if we would what to allow
non-PSCI idle driver for Arm64 is entirely different question that deserves
a separate discussion IMO.

So far we don't have any platform specific PSCI in OSPM and I prefer to keep
it that way.

Sure, we can always review and see if any alternatives are acceptable, but
I am bit nervous to tie this as PSCI if it is not strictly spec compliant.

So all there are platform specific but static information you need from DT ?
If so, what can't it be made part of TF-A and OSPM can avoid interfering
with that info completely. My understanding was that OSPM provides runtime
hints like x86 mwait. If that's not the case, I am failing to understand
the need for OSPM to pass such static information from DT to the firmware.
Why can't that be just part of the firmware to begin with ?

What do you mean by this *"background work load"* ?
