Discussed with Thierry offline which way we prefer to pass the EMC table=20
to the kernel. Some reasons below we decide to chose this one (via=20
binary blob).

- The EMC table is much bigger than the previous Tegra generations=20
(LPDDR4 v.s. LPDDR2/3). It's harder to settle in the review process. And=20
if there is a new fix of the table in the future, we'll need to go=20
through that again.
- Because it's LPDDR4 we want to support here, to support higher rates,=20
the devices have must be gone through the training process, which is=20
done in the firmware. Which means We already have the table somewhere in=20
the memory and kernel can just re-use that. No need to convert them back=20
to DT and pass to the kernel. This is much easier to maintain in the=20
future if there is something needs to fix.
- With the mechanism above, we don't need to maintain the huge EMC table=20
in the DT file like below.
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1063886/
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1063889/

And sorry, maybe it's not clear at that moment, but I did mention that=20
we want to go with the new method (via binary blob) in the previous review.
Please see http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1084467/

Thanks,
Joseph
