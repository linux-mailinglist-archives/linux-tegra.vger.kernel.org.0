Thanks, this looks sane to me!

Right. We may need some more thinking around this, if needed at all (see be=
low).

I am not against doing this in a central place, like $subject patch
suggests. As a matter of fact, it makes perfect sense to me.

However, what I am concerned about, is that you require to use genpd
internal data structures to do it. I think we should try to avoid
that.

I looked at that code and in that path we end up calling
dev_pm_opp_set_rate(), after it has initialized the opp table for the
device.

Rather than doing the OF parsing above to find out the current state
for the device, why can't you just call dev_pm_opp_set_rate() to
initialize a proper vote instead?

Alright, this makes sense to me as well.

Kind regards
