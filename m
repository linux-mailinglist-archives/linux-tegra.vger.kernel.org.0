The "support for waits" is support for the WAIT_SYNCPT command exposed
to userspace, which we could utilize right now.

I'm now concerned about the reserved fields after seeing this reply from
Daniel Vetter:

https://www.mail-archive.com/nouveau@lists.freedesktop.org/msg36324.html

If DRM IOCTL structs are zero-extended, then perhaps we won't need to
reserve anything?

The downstream needs should be irrelevant for the upstream, please read
this:

https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-uapi.html#open-source-userspace-requirements

It may happen that some of the downstream features could become useful
for upstream, but we don't know until we will see the full userspace code.

We don't have a comprehensive userspace which could utilize all the new
features and that's why upstream driver has been stagnated for many
years now. The grate-drivers would greatly benefit from the updated ABI,
but I think that we need at least a usable mesa driver first, that's why
I haven't bothered to upstream anything from the WIP UAPI v2.

In order to upstream new UAPI features we will need:

  1. Hardware specs (from vendor or reverse-engineered).
  2. Regression tests.
  3. A non-toy opensource userspace.

It's the opposite, we don't have userspace which needs majority of the
proposed ABI. This needs to be fixed before we could seriously consider
merging the new features.

I'm pretty sure that you was already aware about all the upstreaming
requirements and we will see the usable opensource userspace at some
point, correct?

For now it will be good to have this series in a form of a
work-in-progress patches, continuing to discuss and update it. Meanwhile
we will need to work on the userspace part as well, which is a much
bigger blocker.

The software-based scheduling is indeed needed for the older SoCs in
order not to block hardware channels and job-submission code paths.
Maybe it could become useful for a newer SoCs as well once we will get
closer to a usable userspace :)

It will be great to have the hardware-based scheduling supported, but I
assume that it needs to be done on top of DRM_SCHED. This should allow
us to remove all the buggy host1x's pushbuffer locking code (which is
known to deadlock) and support a non-host1x fences for free.
