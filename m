There could easily be cases where multiple interconnects are to system
memory but there are additional ones which aren't, so the above wouldn't
be able to represent such cases.

Yeah, I know, that's why there's an XXX comment. =3D) I just wasn't sure
what else to put there and thought this kinda made it clear that it was
only half-baked.

Okay, sounds like "source" in this case means the initiator of the
transaction and destination is the target of the transaction. I had
interpreted the "source" as the "source location" of the transaction (so
for reads the source would be the system memory via the EMC, and for
writes the source would be the memory client interface).

Yeah, I think that makes sense. It was also pointed out to me (offline)
that the above doesn't work as intented for the use-case where I really
need it. The primary reason why I need these "dma-mem" interconnect
paths is so that the memory controller is specified as the "DMA parent"
for these devices, which is important so that the DMA masks can be
correctly set. Having the &emc reference in the first slot breaks that.
Your suggestion makes sense when interpreting the terminology
differently and it fixes the DMA parent issue (at least partially).

I'm not sure if that TEGRA_ICC_EMEM makes a lot of sense. It's always
going to be the same and it's arbitrarily defined, so it's effectively
useless. But other than that it looks good.

I suppose one could argue about the names a bit. Having the "bpmp"
prefix for all of them feels a little redundant. They could also be
[ "read", "write", "dma-read", "dma-write" ], which would make them
a little more contextual, like we do with other clocks.

However, like I said before, at least one of these would need to be
named "dma-mem" in order for the memory controller to be selected as
the DMA parent. But, perhaps we just need to look at this some other
way and specify an additional way of specifying the DMA parent for
devices that doesn't rely on a "dma-mem" interconnect-names property.

Perhaps some new dma-parent property that takes a phandle (with perhaps
an optional specifier) would work? I think that may tie in nicely with
the memory controller mini-framework that I had proposed a while ago.

Rob, any thoughts on that?
