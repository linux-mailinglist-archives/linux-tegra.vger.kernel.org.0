That's your problem. It's not really worth attempting to reason about, 
the architecture says that anything mapped as Normal memory may be 
speculatively accessed at any time, so no amount of second-guessing is 
going to save you in general. Don't make stuff accessible to the kernel 
that it doesn't need to access, and especially don't make stuff 
accessible to the kernel if accessing it will kill the system.

AFAICS the truly correct solution is what Stephen initially suggested 
there - for the boot process to somehow describe which parts of SRAM 
have been reserved by Secure software and/or which parts remain 
Non-Secure, and for the kernel driver to only map and use the latter.
