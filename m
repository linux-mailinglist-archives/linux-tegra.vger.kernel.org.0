But that sounds like exactly the situation for which we introduced 
bus_dma_mask. If "dma-ranges" is found, then we should initialise that 
to reflect the limitation. Drivers may subsequently set a larger mask 
based on what the device is natively capable of, but the DMA API 
internals should quietly clamp that down to the bus mask wherever it 
matters.

Since that change, the initial value of dma_mask and coherent_dma_mask 
doesn't really matter much, as we expect drivers to reset them anyway 
(and in general they have to be able to enlarge them from a 32-bit 
default value).

As far as I'm aware this has been working fine (albeit in equivalent 
ACPI form) for at least one SoC with 64-bit device masks, a 48-bit 
IOMMU, and a 44-bit interconnect in between - indeed if I avoid 
distraction long enough to set up the big new box under my desk, the 
sending of future emails will depend on it ;)
