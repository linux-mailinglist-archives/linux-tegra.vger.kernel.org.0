I was doing that previously, but then realized that for some devices the
state needs to be synced only once device is rpm-resumed. Making RPM
driver to perform the syncing worked well.

It will be extra boilerplate code in the drivers, but perhaps it's the
best option for today, I'll consider it for v8. Thank you for helping
with the review.
