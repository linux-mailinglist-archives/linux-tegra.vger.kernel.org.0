The issue is one convention is consistent for you and only you, the 
other is consistent for *everyone*. And then we'll have someone argue 
they are just following the same convention as Tegra...

If you had several drivers and add a new one, would you argue that the 
new one should follow the conventions of the old drivers rather than 
current conventions? No, you wouldn't.
