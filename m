Randomly jumping in here ...

So if you have a drm driver with userspace in mesa3d already, the
usual approach is to have a libva implementation (ideally in mesa3d
too, using the gallium framework so that a lot of the boring
integration glue is taken care of already) directly on top of drm. No
v4l driver needed at all here.

And it sounds like this nvdec thing would fit that bill pretty neatly.

Above model using libva driver in userspace for nvdec would avoid this
issue too.
