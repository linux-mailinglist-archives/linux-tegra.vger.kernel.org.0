I'm vaguely recalling that there was another reason than just to "make
things cleaner"..

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10938389/#22641053

Secondly, if you're going to use the CCF API for the clock changes, then
I'm not sure that having couple custom clock-API functions sounds too bad.

Lastly, in regards to the cleanup.. at minimum you should strip out all
the unused parts from this code, make a generic cleanup to make it all
look better, address previous comments.
