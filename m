You need different DTS for different number of CPUs. It's not the case
we talk here.

I would argue that for these as well you will have different DTS.

Depends. They know what do they have. If the DTS is the same, then it is
apparently not important to know what do they have because it is all
"the same" (in a compatible meaning).

To Chromium guys I need to spend effort to ask to document at least
something, as they claim any board compatible bindings are useless for
them. It's one border case.

Here, I need to bring it to the middle from another side and border case
- documenting many unneeded compatibles which do not exist in DTS.

It would be much easier if you folks get together and exchange
arguments, not through me. :)

Let me be clear then for this case:
We do not document compatibles for stuff somewhere out-of-tree, just
because it is there or you want it to be there. We document the stuff in
the kernel or other SW projects.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
