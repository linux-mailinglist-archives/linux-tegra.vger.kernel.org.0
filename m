GPIO based PERST# is per-platform requirement.
If DT prop is not present, then devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() returns
NULL gpio_desc.

struct gpio_desc *gpiod_get_from_of_node(struct device_node *node,
                                         const char *propname, int index,
                                         enum gpiod_flags dflags,
                                         const char *label)
{
        struct gpio_desc *desc;
        unsigned long lflags = 0;
        enum of_gpio_flags flags;
        bool active_low = false;
        bool single_ended = false;
        bool open_drain = false;
        bool transitory = false;
        int ret;

        desc = of_get_named_gpiod_flags(node, propname,
                                        index, &flags);

        if (!desc || IS_ERR(desc)) {
*/* If it is not there, just return NULL */****if (PTR_ERR(desc) == -ENOENT)****return NULL;*
                return desc;
        }
	...
