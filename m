Okay, so judging by your and David's feedback, it sounds like I should
add a bit of code to track dynamically allocated areas within a global
list, along with the existing predefined regions and keep totalcma_pages
updated so that the global view is consistent.

I'll look into that. Thanks for the feedback.
