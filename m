Thank you, that makes sense.

Unfortunately running <part list mmc 0> returns "## Unknown partition
table type 0"

This is the result of the gpt guid command:
Tegra30 (Ouya) # gpt guid mmc 0
GUID Partition Table Header signature is wrong: 0x1000 != 0x5452415020494645
find_valid_gpt: *** ERROR: Invalid GPT ***
find_valid_gpt: ***        Using Backup GPT ***
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
success!

The backup GPT is a valid GPT, and linux will pull the partition table
from it if forced to look there.
The android kernel handled this by adding "gpt gpt_sector=15073279" to
the command line.
