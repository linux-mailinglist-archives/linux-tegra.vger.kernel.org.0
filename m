I see. A small question here by the way: By looking at other IOMMU
drivers that are calling driver_find_device_by_fwnode() function,
I found that most of them put_device right after the function call,
and dev_get_drvdata() after putting the device..

Feels like they are doing it wrongly?

I feel so too. The dev is got at of_xlate() that does not have an
obvious counterpart function. So I'll just remove put_device() and
put a line of comments, as you suggested.

Okay.

Got it. Thanks!
