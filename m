To clarify: when I said "isn't a complete solution", what I meant is
that it's not a complete solution to make the implicit IOMMU backing
work with the DMA API. That's what I've got a patch set ready for.

But you said earlier that this change (i.e. putting all DRM devices into
the same IOMMU group) fixes the issue that you were seeing, right? So
that would be an immediate, interim solution, wouldn't it?
