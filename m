I thought that the backup GPT was always present in the standard 
location; it's just the primary GPT that's in an odd location. So, this 
kernel parameter just forces the kernel to look first for the primary 
GPT in the unusual location, thus avoiding an error message when that's 
not there, and the system falls back to the backup GPT.

Or, do I misremember the layout, or the kernel's behaviour if primary 
GPT is missing?
