I'm afraid that's a way too big request to make it universal for anyone
or I'm just failing to understand what you're asking for. In my opinion
it's already understandable by everybody who is really interested in
debugging of this driver. I really don't see how to make it better, in
my opinion it's already ideal.

I'll drop the debug patches from the series in the next revision and
keep them locally for now. Maybe we could get back to this later sometime.
