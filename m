Seeing suggestions like this in messages from seasoned kernel
developers is seriously disappointing. :-/

PM-runtime has always allowed user space to prevent devices from being
suspended and it seems that this has not been taken into account by
Tegra display support developers at all.

I don't quite see the connection here.

Preventing a device from suspending should never be a functional
problem.  It may be an energy-efficiency problem, but that's something
for user space to consider before writing "on" to a device's control
file.

Which doesn't have to be by using PM-runtime suspend for the handling
of system-wide suspend, at least in my view.
