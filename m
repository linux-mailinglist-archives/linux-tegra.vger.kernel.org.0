Yes, that would be an example of "unless the wakeup mechanism is
somehow not an interrupt". I guess I should add not an interrupt from
the perspective of the OS.

So if the wakeup is self contained within the PMIC, why do we need a
DT property? The capability is always there and enabling/disabling
wakeup from it is userspace policy.
