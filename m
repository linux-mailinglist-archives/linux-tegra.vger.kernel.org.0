There could well be cases where you need to explicitly call
devm_kfree(), but having a quick glance at the example above, I don't
see why you would call devm_kfree() here and yes looks like that code
could be simplified significantly. Notice that hisi_sas_debugfs_exit()
does not free any memory as it is not necessary to explicitly do so.

Cheers
