-NVIDIA Tegra186 GPIO controllers
-
-Tegra186 contains two GPIO controllers; a main controller and an "AON"
-controller. This binding document applies to both controllers. The register
-layouts for the controllers share many similarities, but also some significant
-differences. Hence, this document describes closely related but different
-bindings and compatible values.
-
-The Tegra186 GPIO controller allows software to set the IO direction of, and
-read/write the value of, numerous GPIO signals. Routing of GPIO signals to
-package balls is under the control of a separate pin controller HW block. Two
-major sets of registers exist:
-
-a) Security registers, which allow configuration of allowed access to the GPIO
-register set. These registers exist in a single contiguous block of physical
-address space. The size of this block, and the security features available,
-varies between the different GPIO controllers.
-
-Access to this set of registers is not necessary in all circumstances. Code
-that wishes to configure access to the GPIO registers needs access to these
-registers to do so. Code which simply wishes to read or write GPIO data does not
-need access to these registers.
-
-b) GPIO registers, which allow manipulation of the GPIO signals. In some GPIO
-controllers, these registers are exposed via multiple "physical aliases" in
-address space, each of which access the same underlying state. See the hardware
-documentation for rationale. Any particular GPIO client is expected to access
-just one of these physical aliases.
-
-Tegra HW documentation describes a unified naming convention for all GPIOs
-implemented by the SoC. Each GPIO is assigned to a port, and a port may control
-a number of GPIOs. Thus, each GPIO is named according to an alphabetical port
-name and an integer GPIO name within the port. For example, GPIO_PA0, GPIO_PN6,
-or GPIO_PCC3.
-
-The number of ports implemented by each GPIO controller varies. The number of
-implemented GPIOs within each port varies. GPIO registers within a controller
-are grouped and laid out according to the port they affect.
-
-The mapping from port name to the GPIO controller that implements that port, and
-the mapping from port name to register offset within a controller, are both
-extremely non-linear. The header file <dt-bindings/gpio/tegra186-gpio.h>
-describes the port-level mapping. In that file, the naming convention for ports
-matches the HW documentation. The values chosen for the names are alphabetically
-sorted within a particular controller. Drivers need to map between the DT GPIO
-IDs and HW register offsets using a lookup table.
-
-Each GPIO controller can generate a number of interrupt signals. Each signal
-represents the aggregate status for all GPIOs within a set of ports. Thus, the
-number of interrupt signals generated by a controller varies as a rough function
-of the number of ports it implements. Note that the HW documentation refers to
-both the overall controller HW module and the sets-of-ports as "controllers".
-
-Each GPIO controller in fact generates multiple interrupts signals for each set
-of ports. Each GPIO may be configured to feed into a specific one of the
-interrupt signals generated by a set-of-ports. The intent is for each generated
-signal to be routed to a different CPU, thus allowing different CPUs to each
-handle subsets of the interrupts within a port. The status of each of these
-per-port-set signals is reported via a separate register. Thus, a driver needs
-to know which status register to observe. This binding currently defines no
-configuration mechanism for this. By default, drivers should use register
-GPIO_${port}_INTERRUPT_STATUS_G1_0. Future revisions to the binding could
-define a property to configure this.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible
-    Array of strings.
-    One of:
-    - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio".
-    - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio-aon".
-    - "nvidia,tegra194-gpio".
-    - "nvidia,tegra194-gpio-aon".
-- reg-names
-    Array of strings.
-    Contains a list of names for the register spaces described by the reg
-    property. May contain the following entries, in any order:
-    - "gpio": Mandatory. GPIO control registers. This may cover either:
-        a) The single physical alias that this OS should use.
-        b) All physical aliases that exist in the controller. This is
-           appropriate when the OS is responsible for managing assignment of
-           the physical aliases.
-    - "security": Optional. Security configuration registers.
-    Users of this binding MUST look up entries in the reg property by name,
-    using this reg-names property to do so.
-- reg
-    Array of (physical base address, length) tuples.
-    Must contain one entry per entry in the reg-names property, in a matching
-    order.
-- interrupts
-    Array of interrupt specifiers.
-    The interrupt outputs from the HW block, one per set of ports, in the
-    order the HW manual describes them. The number of entries required varies
-    depending on compatible value:
-    - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio": 6 entries.
-    - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio-aon": 1 entry.
-    - "nvidia,tegra194-gpio": 6 entries.
-    - "nvidia,tegra194-gpio-aon": 1 entry.
-- gpio-controller
-    Boolean.
-    Marks the device node as a GPIO controller/provider.
-- #gpio-cells
-    Single-cell integer.
-    Must be <2>.
-    Indicates how many cells are used in a consumer's GPIO specifier.
-    In the specifier:
-    - The first cell is the pin number.
-        See <dt-bindings/gpio/tegra186-gpio.h>.
-    - The second cell contains flags:
-        - Bit 0 specifies polarity
-            - 0: Active-high (normal).
-            - 1: Active-low (inverted).
-- interrupt-controller
-    Boolean.
-    Marks the device node as an interrupt controller/provider.
-- #interrupt-cells
-    Single-cell integer.
-    Must be <2>.
-    Indicates how many cells are used in a consumer's interrupt specifier.
-    In the specifier:
-    - The first cell is the GPIO number.
-        See <dt-bindings/gpio/tegra186-gpio.h>.
-    - The second cell is contains flags:
-        - Bits [3:0] indicate trigger type and level:
-            - 1: Low-to-high edge triggered.
-            - 2: High-to-low edge triggered.
-            - 4: Active high level-sensitive.
-            - 8: Active low level-sensitive.
-            Valid combinations are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.
