I would be in /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/device/power

The short answer is no, the reason being that not all RTCs are connected
to an IRQ or a pin that can wakeup or start the platform. What should be
done is enabling wakeup only when interrupts are available or the
wakeup-source property is in the rtc device tree node.
