It varies. The vast majority of these paths are read/write pairs, which
can be configured separately. There are also cases where multiple paths
are used for load-balancing and I don't think there's any direct
software control over which path will be used.

A third class is where you have one device, but two read/write pairs,
one which is tied to a microcontroller that's part of the device, and
another read/write pair that is used for DMA to/from the device.

Often in the latter case, the microcontroller memory client interfaces
will be used by the microcontroller to read firmware and once the micro-
controller has booted up, the DMA memory client interfaces will be used
to read/write system memory with bulk data (like frame buffers, etc.).

> Is this based on the client/stream ID that you mentioned previously?

These are now all what's call memory client IDs, which identify the
corresponding interface to the memory controller. Stream IDs are
slightly higher-level and typically identify the "module" that uses
the SMMU. Generally a stream ID is mapped to one or more memory client
IDs.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by this last sentence. Are you
saying that each path in terms of the interconnect API is a always a
bidirectional link?

The EMC is the only one where we can scale the frequency, but the MC has
various knobs that can be used to fine-tune arbitration, set maximum
latency, etc.

I vaguely recall Dmitry mentioning that the EMC in early generations of
Tegra used to have controls for individual memory clients, but I don't
see that in more recent generations.
