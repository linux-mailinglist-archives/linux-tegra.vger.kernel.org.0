Right, the only change that is required here is to extend the
reg-names oneOf list of the DT-bindings:
< Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml
with the 'ecam' entry. If it's a vendor-specific part then add to the
last the last entry defines the vendor-specific duplicates of the generic CSR
spaces.

On the other hand I don't really see a reason in adding the ECAM CSRs
space to the generic DW PCIe device since basically the ECAM memory is
just a pre-configured outbound iATU window. So if it's a ECAM-based
device then it should have been already configured by the system
bootloader upon the kernel boot up. Thus there is no point in having
the generic DW PCIe resources and it should be just a generic
ECAM-based device with a single ECAM CSR space as the
"snps,dw-pcie-ecam"/"pci-host-ecam-generic" DT-bindings require
especially seeing the Nvidia low-level driver doesn't use the ECAM
registers at all. Moreover the DW PCIe core driver doesn't
differentiate between the already configured iATU windows and the one
available for the ranges-based mapping. Instead the DW PCIe core just
disables all the detected in- and outbound iATUs by means of the
dw_pcie_iatu_setup() method. So the pre-configured ECAM space will be
reset by the driver core anyway.

What I would suggest here is to split up the devices:
1. If it's a ECAM-based device, then it should be identified as
"snps,dw-pcie-ecam"/"pci-host-ecam-generic", then it will have a
single ECAM CSR space with no need in other resources.
2. If it's a DW PCIe device with Nvidia Tegra194-specific settings,
then it should be identified as "nvidia,tegra194-pcie" with no ECAM
registers.

Thus we wouldn't need to have any modifications applied to the
bindings and to the DT-files. What do you think?
