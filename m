This is architecturally wrong. As i said, swphy emulates a C22 PHY,
and a C22 PHY does not support speeds greater than 1G. To make swphy
really support 5G and 10G, you would need to add C45 support, and then
extend the default genphy driver to look at the C45 registers as well.

However, that is all pointless. As i said, phylink fixed-link is not
limited to 1G speeds. Given what i see in Cc: i assume this is for a
tegre SoC? And that uses a Synopsys MAC? So you probably want to
modify the dwc driver to use phylink.
