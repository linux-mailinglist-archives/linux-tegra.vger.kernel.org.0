Yes, it's completely relevant because it essentially replaces the I2C
DDC. With the AUX bus, the AUX and hence the I2C DDC can be implied from
the bus' parent.

All the (at least relevant) functionality that is in panel-edp was in
panel-simple before it was moved to panel-edp. I've backported this set
of patches to v5.15 and it works just fine there.
