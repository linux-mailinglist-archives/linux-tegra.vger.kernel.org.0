A device should always respond to config reads unless it is in D3cold
or it is initializing after a reset.  IIUC you're doing a resume, not
a reset, so I think your device must be coming out of D3cold.  That's
typically done via ACPI, and I think we are missing some kind of delay
before our first config access:

  pci_power_up
    platform_pci_set_power_state(PCI_D0)    # eg, ACPI
    pci_raw_set_power_state
      pci_read_config_word(PCI_PM_CTRL)     # <-- first config access
      pci_write_config_word(PCI_PM_CTRL)
      pci_read_config_word(PCI_PM_CTRL)
    pci_update_current_state
      if (... || !pci_device_is_present())

Mika is working on some delays for the transition out of D3cold [1].
He's more concerned with a secondary bus behind a bridge, so I don't
think his patch addresses this case, but he's certainly familiar with
this area.

Huh, I'm really confused about this, too.  I don't
understand how resume ever works without any delay between
platform_pci_power_manageable() and the config reads in
pci_raw_set_power_state().  I must be missing something.

The pci_device_is_present() call in pci_update_current_state() was
added by a6a64026c0cd ("PCI: Recognize D3cold in
pci_update_current_state()") [2].  The purpose there is not to wait
for a device to become ready; it is to learn whether the device is in
D3cold.  I don't think we'd want a delay in this path because it would
slow down all transitions into D3cold.
