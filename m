I see.

It seems like it should be a rather common requirement for a genpd
provider - at least for those providers that need to run some
additional operations at system suspend/resume.

I guess the reason for this problem is that the order of how the
devices end up in the dpm_list, doesn't fit well for your case.
Normally, a provider should be registered prior and the consumer, as
that would probably lead to that the provider becomes resumed first.

In any case, to make sure the order becomes correct, a device link
should be created between the genpd domain provider and the consumer
device. As a matter of fact, this is done "automagically" during boot
for DT based platforms, see of_link_property() in
drivers/of/property.c.

Currently these device links are created with DL_FLAG_SYNC_STATE_ONLY,
unless the "fw_devlink" kernel command line specifies a different
option (on == DL_FLAG_AUTOPROBE_CONSUMER). I would try to play with
that and see how that turns out.
