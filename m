Is there more than 1 bpmp? If not you don't need this. Just lookup the
node by compatible.

What additional properties? A continual stream of properties added 1
by 1 would negatively affect my opinion of this.

What happens when you have more than one cpu related driver in
addition to cpufreq? You may still have to end up creating child
platform devices and then gained very little.

You could solve this without DT changes. You can bind on node names.
The driver probe can then check the parent compatible and return if
not matching. I'm not sure if you could get module auto loading to
work in that case. It would have to be based on the root compatible
(rather than the driver match table) and be able to load multiple
matching modules.
