I think you're right, we probably should not try to check "prev_state"
here because we can't rely on that being accurate.

On Tegra, I assume suspend puts the PCIe devices in D3hot, then when
we suspend the RC itself, it looks like tegra_pcie_pm_suspend()
actually turns off the power, so the PCIe devices probably go to
D3cold but nothing updates their dev->current_state, so it's probably
still PCI_D3hot.

On Tegra194, the same probably happens, except that when we suspend
the RC itself, tegra_pcie_downstream_dev_to_D0() puts the PCIe devices
back in D0 (updating their dev->current_state to PCI_D0), and then we
turn off the power, so they probably also end up in D3cold but with
dev_current_state still set to PCI_D0.

I think you're right.  We can't tell what dev->current_state is when
we enter pci_power_up().
