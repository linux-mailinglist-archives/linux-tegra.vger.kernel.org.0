You mean to drop the mclk-fs property? I can't do that because I
actually need a frequency of 256 * sample rate. But that doesn't
necessarily need to be the MCLK, because the codec itself has a
FLL/PLL which can be used to generate any frequency for a given
MCLK. So that is a valid scenario. See also commit 13409d27cb39
("ASoC: wm8904: configure sysclk/FLL automatically").
