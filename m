Some host controllers need to know the existence of clkreq signal routing to
downstream devices to be able to advertise low power features like ASPM L1
substates. Without clkreq signal routing being present, enabling ASPM L1 sub
states might lead to downstream devices falling off the bus. Hence a new device
tree property 'supports-clkreq' is added to make such host controllers
aware of clkreq signal routing to downstream devices.
