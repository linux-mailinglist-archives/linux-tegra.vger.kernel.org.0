Yeah with the DT model of how a SoC works, all these tiny little devices
are essentially implementation details that userspace really shouldn't
ever care about, much less change anything with them.

If userspace doesn't want the gpu to auto-suspend, then there's the
overall gpu device that it can set that on, and I guess doing that should
not break a decently written driver. For all the others insisting that
userspace can be stupid essentially means we get to hand roll large chunks
of runtime pm in drivers, which feels rather pointless. We have a lot of
that home-grown runtime pm for subcomponents in i915, and I very much
understand why the DT folks wanted to standardize all that with lots of
little explicit devices.

Maybe the mistake was simply allowing these to be visible to userspace.
