Subject: [PATCH v8 0/7] Support DRM bridges on NVIDIA Tegra

Hello,

This series adds initial support for the DRM bridges to NVIDIA Tegra DRM
driver. This is required by newer device-trees where we model the LVDS
encoder bridge properly.

Changelog:

v8: - The new of_graph_get_local_port() helper is replaced with the
      of_graph_presents(), which simply checks the graph presence in a
      given DT node. Thank to Laurent Pinchart for the suggestion!

    - The of_graph_get_local_port() is still there, but now it isn't a public
      function anymore. In the review to v7 Laurent Pinchart suggested that
      the function's doc-comments and name could be improved and I implemented
      these suggestions in v8.

    - A day ago I discovered that devm_drm_panel_bridge_add() requires
      panel to have connector type to be properly set, otherwise function
      rejects panels with the incomplete description. So, I checked what
      LVDS panels are used on Tegra and fixed the missing connector types
      in this new patch:

        drm/panel-simple: Add missing connector type for some panels

v7: - Removed the obscure unused structs (which GCC doesn't detect, but CLANG
      does) in the patch "Wrap directly-connected panel into DRM bridge",
      which was reported by kernel test robot for v6.

v6: - Added r-b and acks from Rob Herring and Sam Ravnborg.

    - Rebased on a recent linux-next, patches now apply without fuzz.

v5: - Added new patches that make drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() more usable
      if graph isn't defined in a device-tree:

        of_graph: add of_graph_get_local_port()
        drm/of: Make drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() to check graph's presence

    - Updated "Support DRM bridges" patch to use drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge()
      directly and added WARN_ON(output->panel || output->bridge) sanity-check.

    - Added new "Wrap directly-connected panel into DRM bridge" patch, as
      was suggested by Laurent Pinchart.

v4: - Following review comments that were made by Laurent Pinchart to the v3,
      we now create and use the "bridge connector".

v3: - Following recommendation from Sam Ravnborg, the new bridge attachment
      model is now being used, i.e. we ask bridge to *not* create a connector
      using the DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR flag.

    - The bridge is now created only for the RGB (LVDS) output, and only
      when necessary. For now we don't need bridges for HDMI or DSI outputs.

    - I noticed that we're leaking OF node in the panel's error code path,
      this is fixed now by the new patch "Don't leak OF node on error".

v2: - Added the new "rgb: Don't register connector if bridge is used"
      patch, which hides the unused connector provided by the Tegra DRM
      driver when bridge is used, since bridge provides its own connector
      to us.
