1. WiFi devices provides power-off feature for power saving in mobiles.
When WiFi is turned off we shouldn't power on the HW back without user
turning it back on.
2. When ever user process tries to access config space, it'll end up
in these functions. We cannot have is_powered_on check in config read/write
callbacks.
3. WiFi power on/off is device specific feature, we shouldn't handle it
in PCI subsystem or host controller driver.

This should be handled by hotplug feature, whenever endpoint is powered-off/
removed from the slot, hot unplug event should take care of it. Unfortunately
Tegra PCIe doesn't support hotplug feature.
