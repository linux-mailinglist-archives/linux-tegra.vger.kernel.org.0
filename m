Hello,

The h/w mitigation is much more reactive than software, in the same time
it's much less flexible than software. It should provide additional
protection in a cases where software isn't doing a good job. Ideally h/w
mitigation should stay inactive all the time, nevertheless it should be
modeled properly by the driver.

The generic cpufreq_cooling already uses QoS for limiting the CPU
frequency. It could be okay to use QoS for the OF drivers, this needs a
closer look.

We have the case where CPU frequency is changed by the thermal event and
the thermal pressure equation is the same for both s/w cpufreq_cooling
and h/w thermal driver. The pressure is calculated based on the QoS
cpufreq constraint that is already aggregated.

Hence what we may need to do on the thermal event is:

1. Update the QoS request
2. Update the thermal pressure
3. Ensure that updates are not racing

Thank you for the clarification and suggestion.
