That is indeed tricky.
I would've found it super appealing to always just have sugov DL tasks activate
on this_cpu and not have to worry about all this, but then you have contention
amongst CPUs of a cluster and there are energy improvements from always
having little cores handle all sugov DL tasks, even for the big CPUs,
that's why I introduced
commit 93940fbdc468 ("cpufreq/schedutil: Only bind threads if needed")
but that really doesn't make this any easier.
