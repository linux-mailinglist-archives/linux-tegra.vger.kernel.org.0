.*-pins$ is what I've been using/proposing. Doing that also helps
writing pinctrl schemas.

Pretty sure we only allow pwm@.* or pwm-[0-9a-f]+, so this would not match.

Plus shouldn't it be just 'fan' to be what the class is, not how it is
implemented/controlled.

There's only 2 things we can generically check, #pwm-cells and the
node name. If we match on one, then we're really only checking the
other one. We could match on #pwm-cells presence and then check its
value is 2 or 3, but then we can do that without a select (i.e. always
apply the schema).

So I guess I'm convinced there's not much value here and we should
just do 1). Patches welcome. :) (BTW, I do think we should do some
mass conversions by class. That I think would be a bit more efficient
in both converting and reviewing. My calculation is something like 6
years to finish (3K bindings left and doing 100-150 a cycle).)

That's unfortunate...

The question is how do we allow this, but at the same time prevent more cases.

In general, we need some solution for the more than 1 function nodes.
Combo clock and reset controllers are a common one.

Yes. :(

Maybe node name checks can be an optional thing to enable until we
come up with a more general way to opt-in/out of specific checks.
