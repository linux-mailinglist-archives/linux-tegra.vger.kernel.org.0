Hi Greg,

Yes, we we don't have failure as of today with mmc devices we are using 
on our platforms.

But this is something thats missing from the beginning to handle 
commands that takes longer than max host timeout and it may fail if any 
operation takes more than max host timeout limit.

So, can we please have this applied to 4.19.113? I will also send 
patches to backport for 5.4 and 5.5?

Thanks

Sowjanya
