This is the original RT5631 driver from ASUS [1].

I briefly looked at the RT5631 datasheet and don't see it saying
anything about the clk rate requirement >=6MHz. There are PLL tables
with the MCLK for the reference clock. For now I'm not sure what
downstream kernel tries to achieve, perhaps we should try to check
whether all audio rates work for RT5631.

But what benefits this extension will bring to us if the end result is
the same?

Alright, I'll move it to the WM8903 driver in v4. It won't be a problem
to make that function shared once will be actually needed.
