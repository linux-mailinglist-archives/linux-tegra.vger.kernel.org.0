You got this right.

Yes, the OPPs are specified only for the core domain.

See patches which are adding domains and OPPs to DTs:

Still it requires a platform-specific knowledge. It could be some new
genpd hook for the initialization. But I don't know what other platforms
may want to initialize, so it's not clear to me how to make it generic.

We did that in a previous versions of this series where drivers were
calling devm_tegra_core_dev_init_opp_table() helper during the probe to
initialize performance state of the domain. Moving OPP state
initialization into central place made drivers cleaner by removing the
boilerplate code.

I can revert back to the previous variant, although this variant works
well too.

Domains themselves don't change OPP, there is no problem with that. The
point is to have cleaner code in the drivers.
