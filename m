Maybe I should stand back to avoid getting hit by tomatoes, but IMO
it's a terrible idea to try to update devices trees separately from
kernels for any sufficiently complicated device. I won't stop you from
shooting yourself in the foot, but I also certainly wouldn't encourage
it. I've always said that I'll accept that this is something to really
worry about when we land chunk of "device tree fixup" code that runs
in early boot to fix all the broken device trees out there. All ARM
Chrome OS devices that have ever shipped all bundle device trees
together with the kernel (they bundle a whole pile of them and the
bootloader picks the right one based on model). Sure, someone could
decide to bake one into their bootloader but, even aside from this
case, there are sometimes bugs in device trees and they need to get
fixed. Updating your kernel without your device tree is just bad juju
IMO.

I'll let you and Thierry figure out what you want to do for 5.15. In
the Chrome OS 5.15 kernel tree we simply backported all the edp-panel
stuff, which was fairly clean. I even backported all that stuff to
5.4, but it was decidedly more complex...
