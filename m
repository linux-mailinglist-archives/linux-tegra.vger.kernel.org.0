Sorry for being slow on this. I have 2 concerns.

First, this creates an ABI issue. A DT with cells in 'memory-region' 
will not be understood by an existing OS. I'm less concerned about this 
if we address that with a stable fix. (Though I'm pretty sure we've 
naively added #?-cells in the past ignoring this issue.)

Second, it could be the bootloader setting up the reserved region. If a 
node already has 'memory-region', then adding more regions is more 
complicated compared to adding new properties. And defining what each 
memory-region entry is or how many in schemas is impossible.

Both could be addressed with a new property. Perhaps something like 
'iommu-memory-region = <&phandle>;'. I think the 'iommu' prefix is 
appropriate given this is entirely because of the IOMMU being in the 
mix. I might feel differently if we had other uses for cells, but I 
don't really see it in this case. 

Rob
