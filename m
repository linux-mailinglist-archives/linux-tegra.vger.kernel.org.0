Okay

Indeed

The !power_on case should be skipped at all because common core code
can't handle it properly, hence rpm_pstate shouldn't be touched. I
realized it only after sending out this email.

I see now what you meant, it's actually a simpler variant and it works
too. Thank you for the suggestion, I'll prepare v8.
