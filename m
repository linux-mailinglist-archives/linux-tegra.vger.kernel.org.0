Please can you drop this patch?

Per some offline review with Morimoto-san, it turns out that the actual
issue resided in my DT (which was incorrect) and not the simple-card
machine driver.

In my DT I incorrectly had ...

sound {
	compatible = "simple-audio-card";

	...
=>	simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&codec>;
=>	simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&codec>;
	...

	simple-audio-card,cpu {
		sound-dai = <&xxx>;
	};

	simple-audio-card,codec {
=>		sound-dai = <&codec>;
	};
};

But I should have had ...

sound {
	compatible = "simple-audio-card";

	...
=>	simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&codec>;
=>	simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&codec>;
	...

	simple-audio-card,cpu {
		sound-dai = <&xxx>;
	};

=>	codec: simple-audio-card,codec {	/* simple-card wants here */
		sound-dai = <&xxx>;		/* not here */
	};
};

Thanks to Morimoto-san for correcting me!

Cheers
Jon
