 all for us?

My understanding is that a task that goes to sleep can be migrated to
another CPU, so there's got to be code in place already to account for
that. Migrating from one CPU to another is not very different from
resuming a task on the same CPU.

But yeah, I'm not very firm on the fundamentals here either, so a bit of
clarification from Daniel or Thomas would help.
