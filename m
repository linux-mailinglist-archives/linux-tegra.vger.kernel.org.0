Reserved regions themselves are software descriptions, no? Then we have 'pool'
flag which is again a software flag and so on. This flag falls into same
category and nothing out of ordinary.

Yes, here are a few examples:
arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-g*.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/at91*.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm7445.dtsi
Then arch/arm/boot/dts/dra7.dtsi is an example where we should map everything
except the reserved region.

It will break compatibility with existing dtbs.

User doesnâ€™t need sram driver in that case. It can use genalloc api directly.
