I don't see a particular problem with this -- I think it's better to 
keep the data structures in the driver-internal headers to to improve 
modularization. I think we can get rid of the syncpt_get_by_id* 
functions once we remove the staging code, so that would clean up things 
as well.

My feeling is that once we have the new UAPI implemented, refactoring 
will be easier because we have a better idea of what we need of the 
code, and we will be able to remove the staging code, allowing removal 
or easier refactoring of many old paths.

While doing that, some of the new code will have to be changed again as 
well, sure, but at least the entire time we will have a functional 
implementation.
