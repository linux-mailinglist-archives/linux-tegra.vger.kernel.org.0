Thank you very much! I'll go through yours comments and reply to them.

I understand that it's not easy for you to review patch5, but probably
you don't need to go into details and a brief-generic review of the code
will be enough in that case.

The hardware is actually very simple, there are watermarks that
correspond to a memory activity that hardware accounts over a given
period of time. Once watermark is reached, hardware generates interrupt.
There are two types of watermarks: average and consecutive. In case of
the average, the memory activity is collected over a larger window of
time. For the consecutive case, the memory activity is collected over
each period (16ms by default in the driver). Memory client may breach
average watermark very frequently, although that may not affect much the
average value and for some memory clients (like CPU) it is more
preferred to not completely ignore those short bursts of memory
activity. The consecutive watermarks are used in order to detect those
short bursts, which we account in the driver in a form of boosting. You
may notice that boost_up_coeff for the CPU's memory client is set to a
higher value in the driver.

Indeed, will be very nice if Thierry could also take a look at this
series. Although.. I could be wrong here, but it looks to me that
Thierry also isn't closely familiar with this driver and the hardware.

Thierry, at least please let us know if you're interested in taking a
look at the patches, I'm pretty sure that you're quite busy with other
things ;)
