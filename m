-Device tree binding for NVIDIA Tegra XUSB pad controller
-========================================================
-
-The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
-signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
-is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
-documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
-and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
-separately configured and powered up.
-
-Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
-super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
-or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
-contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
-ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.
-
-In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
-settings on a per-board basis.
-
-Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
-device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
-own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
-PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.
-
-The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
-pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
-"port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
-tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
-abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
-for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
-USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).
-

+title: NVIDIA Tegra124 XUSB pad controller

+
+description:
+  The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
+  signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
+  is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
+  documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
+  and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
+  separately configured and powered up.
+
+  Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
+  super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
+  or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
+  contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
+  ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.
+
+  In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
+  settings on a per-board basis.
+
+  Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
+  device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
+  own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
+  PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.
+
+  The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
+  pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
+  "port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
+  tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
+  abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
+  for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
+  USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

+
+description:
+  The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
+  signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
+  is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
+  documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
+  and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
+  separately configured and powered up.
+
+  Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
+  super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
+  or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
+  contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
+  ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.
+
+  In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
+  settings on a per-board basis.
+
+  Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
+  device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
+  own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
+  PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.
+
+  The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
+  pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
+  "port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
+  tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
+  abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
+  for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
+  USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

+title: NVIDIA Tegra194 XUSB pad controller
+
+maintainers:
+  - Thierry Reding <thierry.reding@gmail.com>

+
+description:
+  The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
+  signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
+  is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
+  documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
+  and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
+  separately configured and powered up.
+
+  Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
+  super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
+  or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
+  contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
+  ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.
+
+  In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
+  settings on a per-board basis.
+
+  Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
+  device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
+  own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
+  PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.
+
+  The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
+  pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
+  "port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
+  tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
+  abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
+  for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
+  USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

+
+      The "status" property is used to enable or disable the use of a pad.
+      If set to "disabled", the pad will not be used on the given board. In

+      to "okay".

+
+description:
+  The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
+  signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
+  is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
+  documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
+  and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
+  separately configured and powered up.
+
+  Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
+  super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
+  or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
+  contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
+  ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.
+
+  In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
+  settings on a per-board basis.
+
+  Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
+  device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
+  own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
+  PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.
+
+  The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
+  pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
+  "port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
+  tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
+  abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
+  for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
+  USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

+      pad node.
+
+      The "status" property is used to enable or disable the use of a pad.
+      If set to "disabled", the pad will not be used on the given board. In
+      order to use the pad and any of its lanes, this property must be set
+      to "okay".
