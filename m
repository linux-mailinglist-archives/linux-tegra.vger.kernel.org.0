That would happen anyway if arch_freq_get_on_cpu() is called from
cpufreq_verify_current_freq().

In principle, according to [1], it would be correct to use it for
'cpuinfo_cur_freq' and not 'scaling_cur_freq'. But the call from
show_scaling_cur_freq() is already there before these patches,
introduced a long time ago for x86.

The topic was discussed at [2] and the agreement so far was that it
would be best to keep the behaviour the same for both x86 and arm.

I don't like going against the user-guide, but these patches don't
actually go against the user-guide. The old call to
arch_freq_get_on_cpu() from show_scaling_cur_freq() goes against it.
But I agree that's something necessary to keep, as legacy for x86.
Additionally, you also mentioned that you'd prefer to have a more
accurate frequency returned for 'scaling_cur_freq'.
