Saravana had submitted a very similar patch (I don't have a pointer to
that one though) and I was against it at that time due to
overhead-related concerns.  There still are some, but maybe that
doesn't matter in practice.

Also, I kind of expect this to blow up somewhere, but since I have no
examples ready from the top of my head, I think let's try and see, so:
