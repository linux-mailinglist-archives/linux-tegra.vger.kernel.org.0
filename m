Not all hardware has five levels of page tables.  When hardware does not
have five levels, it is common to "roll up" some of the page tables into
others.

There are generic ways to implement this, which include using:

include/asm-generic/pgtable-nop4d.h
include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopud.h
include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h

and then there's architecture ways to implement this.  32-bit ARM takes
its implementation for PMD not from the generic version, which
post-dates 32-bit ARM, but from how page table roll-up was implemented
back at the time when the current ARM scheme was devised.  The generic
scheme is unsuitable for 32-bit ARM since we do more than just roll-up
page tables, but this is irrelevent for this discussion.

All three of the generic implementations, and 32-bit ARM, define the
pXX_addr_end() macros thusly:

include/asm-generic/pgtable-nop4d.h:#define p4d_addr_end(addr, end) (end)
include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h:#define pmd_addr_end(addr, end) (end)
include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopud.h:#define pud_addr_end(addr, end) (end)
arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-2level.h:#define pmd_addr_end(addr,end) (end)

since, as I stated, pXX_addr_end() expects its "end" argument to be
the address index of the next entry in the immediately upper page
table level, or the address index of the last entry we wish to
process, which ever is smaller.

If it's larger than the address index of the next entry in the
immediately upper page table level, then the effect of all these
macros will be to walk off the end of the current level of page
table.

To see how they _should_ be used, see the loops in free_pgd_range()
and the free_pXX_range() functions called from there and below.

In all cases when the pXX_addr_end() macro was introduced, what I state
above holds true - and I believe still holds true today, until this
patch that has reportedly caused issues.
