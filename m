I'm sorry about that, but it's better to create a tracked ticket (issue or
pull request).

Yes, it's based on the driver name (which is incorrectly set /or not set/ in
your case).

Lookup paths (with description):

https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf/blob/master/ucm2/ucm.conf

The latest scheme is even different - lookups were moved to ucm2/conf.d with
redirection to the more descriptive layered configuration tree structure, so
the other developers can immediately identify the hardware which is
configured. See Qualcomm examples. The long card names does not help us so much.

Fields are explained in:

https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf/blob/master/ucm2/README.md

> Is there anything on the kernel side that I could change to get a working naming scheme? If yes, I may try to do something about it in the v2, thanks in advance.

Try to set a meaningful driver name (usually the code handling the ASoC card
creation). It should be very close to the kernel module name (but more user
friendly). The current code for your hardware use the auto-generated driver
name from the ALSA long name.

Then try to reuse the existing configs - for example your Nexus 7 config has
many blocks from codecs/rt5640/* .

Anyway, create a PR so we can discuss the details.
