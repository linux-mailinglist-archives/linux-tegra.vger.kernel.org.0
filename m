Ok, I'll implement Option 1 soon. Also, thinking more about it, I
don't like converting it into STATELESS links. It's easy to do, but it
doesn't feel right for the driver core to "create" a STATELESS link
and then "forget" about it. So, when a device is force bound, I'll
just delete the links where the suppliers haven't probed yet.
