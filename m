Perhaps leave away the "core_" prefix here and simply call this "apb"?

This is a descriptive text, so it makes sense to spell out "performance"
for better readability.

I'm not sure if I asked this before, but can we not determine that the
configuration matches one of these conditions and select FC fixup mode
at runtime in that case?

You can drop the quotes around the property names. Also, perhaps also
capitalize "Time" since it's part of the acronym expansion for CMRT.

The example below looks like it's got board specific bits in it, so
perhaps just drop the "SoC DTSI:" caption.

Use the symbolic definitions GIC_SPI and IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH here as
well.

This should contain a controller ID according to the bindings.

This is no longer documented above.

This is no longer documented above.

Perhaps align the individual cells to make this more readable?
