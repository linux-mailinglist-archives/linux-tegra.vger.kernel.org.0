True, but the commit message isn't entirely accurate as-is, because on
later Tegra SoCs the driver does a bit more than that. So if you don't
mind I'll reword this to be a little more accurate if I end up deciding
to apply it.

Again, true. But -EPROBE_DEFER is a silent error, so if somebody indeed
has DMADEVICES disabled and TEGRA20_APB_DMA is not available, then they
will not get FUSE support and they are going to struggle to find out why
that's not working.

I don't entirely agree with this. Dependencies (and especially selects)
are used to pull in driver and/or features that are generally considered
useful. In this particular case, TEGRA20_APB_DMA is needed for the FUSE
driver to work correctly on Tegra20. Whether FUSE support on Tegra20 is
useful or not isn't quite relevant at this point.

There's also a balance as to what makes sense and what doesn't. APB DMA
is a useful feature in itself and disabling it is very much discouraged
because there are plenty of other drivers that can make use of it. That
is also the reason why we enable it in the default configuration. So I
don't consider a select on a symbol that's enabled by default an extra
dependency. Instead it's more of an explicit statement that you really
do want this enabled if you want that driver to work.

And like I said, if we don't have this and the driver will fail to probe
because of -EPROBE_DEFER, the user is going to have a very difficult
time of finding out why exactly that's happening. We're not even
emitting an error for this, so there's no way of knowing, even if they
enable driver debugging, /why/ the FUSE driver isn't working.
