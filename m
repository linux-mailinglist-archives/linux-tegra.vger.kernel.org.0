This is for all S2CR registers. There's no chance to change this and get
it deployed on all the devices people care about.

As you know John need this for the RB3/db845c, where we might have a
chance to modify the firmware.

But I'm writing this on my Lenovo Yoga C630 and John and his colleagues
are working on various phones, such as Pixel 3. None of these boots
without this "workaround" and I don't expect that we can propagate a
firmware modification to any of them - and definitely not all of them.

Understood.
