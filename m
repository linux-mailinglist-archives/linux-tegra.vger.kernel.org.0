IMO this does not belong in drm_simple_kms - but in drm_encoder.
This only occurs to me after looking a bit more on the patches,
you would have loved to get this feedback earlier.

Most users do not need their owm drm_encoder_funcs definition,
and would be happy with the default as provided by drm_simple_*

As the cleanup is handled automatically when the drm device
is teared down (in mode_config_rest()) I considered if we could here
use the drmm_ namespace - but that felt wrong.

My proposal is the following:
- Move the implementation to drm_encoder.c
- Name it drm_encoder_init_nofuncs()

The patches posted in this thread would be a little simpler
as they would loose the added include file.
And the three drivers using the current infrastructure would need a
small update.

I you decide to keep the current approach where the
functions are in drm_simple_* then the full series is:
Acked-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

But I think moving it to drm_encoder.c would be the approach that would
make it simpler to understand/follow. So that get my (biased) vote.

	Sam
