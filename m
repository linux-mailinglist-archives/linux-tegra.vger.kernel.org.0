Indeed, it will be much better if Yangtao could make the update, no
doubt about this.

If devm_tegra_core_dev_init_opp_table() will miss 5.12, then it will
likely put on hold couple Tegra patches for a another 2+ months, which
isn't critical, but it's a bit difficult to accept morally :)

Yangtao, could you please let us know the current status of yours
series? If you don't have spare time right now to finish v2, then I'd
like to pick up couple patches from yours v1 which add the devm_*
helpers that are used by this patch to make a small patchset that could
go into 5.12.
