I suspect that any overhead would be offset if we can get rid of the
deferred probe reordering and the recursive provider/consumer reordering
as discussed with Saravana in that other subthread. Even if we can't do
that, this is a one-time cost per device and therefore shouldn't have a
huge impact.

Besides, as the example above and Saravana's in the discussion in June
shows, there are certain cases where we just have no other way of doing
the sorting correctly, so I think we need this for correctness.

I'm slightly worried about that, too. But I did give this quite a bit of
thought and I can't come up with a case where this would blow up. Maybe
the one case where this might break something is if some combination of
drivers specifically rely on the suspend/resume order to be *different*
=66rom the probe order. That's a bit far-fetched and I would think that
either driver would have a workaround in place to deal with that somehow
so this might actually unveil such workarounds and gives us an
opportunity to do things right.

But I think it'd probably be best to feed this into linux-next sometime
soon after v5.11-rc1 to get broad exposure and see if there are any
cases where this causes trouble.
