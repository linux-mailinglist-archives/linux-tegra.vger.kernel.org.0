Alas, that still will not work, because things like
acpi_processor_ppc_init() only work accidentally for one-CPU policies.
Generally, adding such a PM QoS request to a non-policy CPU simply has
no effect until it becomes a policy CPU which may be never.

It looks like using device PM QoS for cpufreq is a mistake in general
and what is needed is a struct pm_qos_constraints member in struct
cpufreq_policy and something like

struct freq_pm_qos_request {
        enum freq_pm_qos_req_type type; /* min or max */
        struct plist_node pnode;
        struct cpufreq_policy *policy;
};

Then, pm_qos_update_target() can be used for adding, updating and
removing requests.
