Yes exactly.

Currently, if the frequency is not known, we fail right before we do the
initial frequency check [0].

Actually it can and it does currently. Note in tegra186_cpufreq_get()
the variable 'freq' is initialised to 0, and if no match is found, then
it returns 0. This is what happens currently on some Tegra186 boards.

No problem, this has been an on-going saga now for sometime.
