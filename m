Liam, Mark,

there's a few runtime dependencies between the various patches in this
series, so I think it'd probably be best if I picked up the ASoC patches
into the Tegra tree and let them soak for a day or two in linux-next to
make sure everything is there and in the right order.

Do you mind if I pick them up and send to you as a pull request in the
next few days?

If you'd prefer to pick these up yourself that should be fine as well.
They've all got acks from me and the runtime dependencies are causing
annoying, though harmless, warnings during boot, so I think it'd be fine
as long as all the patches end up getting merged for v5.7-rc1.

If you do decide to pick these up yourselves, please omit patch 11 in
the series since that doesn't do what it's expected to.

Thierry
