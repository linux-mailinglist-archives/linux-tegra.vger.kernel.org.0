Ah, interesting.  And where is that sector in relation to where the
backup should be?  I'm not sure off-hand how easy it would be to make
backup location easy to run-time configure, but if it's lba - 2 instead
of lba - 1 or something, we could add a build-time "also check.." thing,
if it's a consistent offset, and probably is.  Similarly, we could add
something kinda ugly to allow overriding GPT_PRIMARY_PARTITION_TABLE_LBA
with where that is instead.

Other-otherwise, I know there's patches in progress to support "tegra
partition table" for Linux and doing that for U-Boot could be handy and
fix this problem as well?
