I agree that it is better to maintain proper typing everywhere in
general, I have been bitten so many times by typecasting bugs..
Opentegra's Bool (unsigned) -> BOOL (signed) casting horror was the most
recent one. Well, I guess indeed it won't hurt to apply your suggestion
in a follow-up patch to keep things a bit more consistent.
