Thank you for the clarification! If device makes a special use of lm90,
then very likely that it won't attach sensor to thermal zone. At least
all devices supported by mainline kernel should be okay here.

I think other sensors should be in a similar position. If a more complex
solution will be needed, then indeed hwmon API could be improved
further. The thermal device is created only for hwmon sensors that are
attached to thermal zone in a device-tree, so the scope of potentially
affected device should be small. Seems lm90 is actually the only hwmon
sensor that is used by thermal zones today.

AFAICS, all drivers return -EOPNOTSUPP if limits can't be changed, so we
could equal this error code to success in a case of set_trips(). The
set_trips() is very optional, if driver can't set limits, then the trips
won't trigger and thermal core will continue to work like set_trips()
wasn't hooked up. I'll implement this in v2.
