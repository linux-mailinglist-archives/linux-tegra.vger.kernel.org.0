After applying this series it does indeed seem to be working. The only
thing I had to do was add a dma-ranges property to the DMA parent. I
ended up doing that via an interconnects property because the default
DMA parent on Tegra194 is /cbb which restricts #address-cells =3D <1> and
#size-cells =3D <1>, so it can't actually translate anything beyond 32
bits of system memory.

So I basically ended up making the memory controller an interconnect
provider, increasing #address-cells =3D <2> and #size-cells =3D <2> again
and then using a dma-ranges property like this:

	dma-ranges =3D <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x80 0x0>;

to specify that only 39 bits should be used for addressing, leaving the
special bit 39 up to the driver to set as required.

Coincidentally making the memory controller an interconnect provider is
something that I was planning to do anyway in order to support memory
frequency scaling, so this all actually fits together pretty elegantly.
