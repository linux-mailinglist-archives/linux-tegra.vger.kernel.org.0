Hi Dmitry,

Secure boot currently is enabled only on Tegra210 and Tegra210=20
bootloader doesn't enable PLLM override.

So PLLM override/PLLE IDDQ being in clock driver currently will not=20
break on any of existing Tegra platforms.

Blink init state is set to true for both Tegra20 and Tegra30 and all go=20
through the same blink programming sequence.

Will try to add more debug messages to dump registers and will test=20
blink through device tree on T30 and will get back...
