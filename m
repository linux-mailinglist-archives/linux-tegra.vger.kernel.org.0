Yes, this is taken care.

XBAR currently exports all routing widgets which can be used to=20
interconnect multiple components and thus implements Mux widgets. Fixing=20
the routing paths in driver would limit anyone to try a different=20
combination as per the need, unless driver is modified. Device tree (DT)=20
can be one of the solutions here, but currently static paths can only be=20
added AFAIK. Even if this is extended to include routes with Mux=20
widgets, still it won't give the real flexibility. I cannot re-use a=20
component for a different routing path, unless DT is modified again.

Hence a Mux widget with user space control could offer required=20
flexibility.

I registered XBAR device as a component having a dummy DAI just to allow=20
routing paths to be available for the given sound card. Are you=20
suggesting I can register XBAR as an auxiliary device so that all the=20
routing paths are available?

In the current design we achieve this by using codec-to-codec links and=20
attempt here is if we can use DPCM to simplify few things.

Yes this seems to be the case. All of my BE DAIs are added to the list=20
and callbacks happen for all. DPCM is viewing these as parallel paths.

I was earlier thinking if dpcm_be_dai_hw_params() can be enhanced to=20
propagate PCM parameters (sample rate, channels, sample size) from BE to=20
BE. This is a rough idea, I have not tried this. But because of above it=20
will be a problem unless real parallel paths are not differentiated.
For example:
ADMAIF1(FE) ---> SFC1 ---> I2S1 (operated at 48 kHz)
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 |--> SF=
C2 ---> I2S2 (operated at 16 kHz)

If I understand correctly, this problem will be there if I want to drive=20
multiple paths with the "same FE". I am not sure how often we have such=20
requirements.
For example below would work fine (though it is functionally not same as=20
above example):
ADMAIF1(FE) ---> SFC1 ---> I2S1 (operated at 48 kHz)
ADMAIF2(FE) ---> SFC2 ---> I2S2 (operated at 16 kHz)
