Do you have "lspci -vvxxx" output for the root ports handy?

If there's some clue in the standard config space that would tell us
that MSI works for some events but not others, we could make the PCI
core pay attention it.  That would be the best solution because it
wouldn't require Tegra-specific code.

If this situation requires Tegra-specific code, that becomes an issue
if you ever want to use the part in an ACPI system because the ACPI
host bridge driver is generic and there isn't a place to put
device-specific code.
