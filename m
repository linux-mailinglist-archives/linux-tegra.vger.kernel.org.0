PMC clock gate is based on the state of CLKx_ACCEPT_REQ and FORCE_EN=20
like explained above.

CLKx_ACCEPT_REQ is 0 default and FORCE_EN acts as gate to enable/disable=20
EXTPERIPH clock output to PMC CLK_OUT_1/2/3.

So I believe we need to register as MUX and Gate rather than as a single=20
clock. Please confirm.
