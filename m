What about variant with a "descriptor" properties that will describe
each region:

fb_desc: display-framebuffer-memory-descriptor {
	needs-identity-mapping;
}

display@52400000 {
	memory-region = <&fb ...>;
	memory-region-descriptor = <&fb_desc ...>;
};

It could be a more flexible/extendible variant.
