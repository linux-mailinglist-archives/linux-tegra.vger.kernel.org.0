I assume that your device is coming out of D3cold because apparently
you're seeing a CRS status from the config read when
pci_update_current_state() calls pci_device_is_present().  CRS status
should only happen after reset or power-on from D3cold, and you're not
doing a reset.

I'm pretty sure platform_pci_power_manageable() returns false on
your system (can you confirm that?) because the only scenarios with
platform power management are MID (Intel platform) and ACPI (which you
don't have).

Maybe you have some other platform-specific mechanism that controls
power to PCI devices, and it's not integrated into the
platform_pci_*() framework?
