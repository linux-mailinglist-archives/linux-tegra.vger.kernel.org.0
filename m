I don't think so, I'd not expect the individual drivers to be doing
anything user visible here - if we know what a digital transformation
looks like the framework should be offering anything that's needed to
users (and hiding controls that don't have any practical control in a
given system).

Internal testing often requires things that can't be exposed to users,
the extreme examples are things like battery chargers with health and
safety issues if the full range of control is available.
