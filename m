So sorry for the very late reply.  I have tried the patches but
hit some issues on linux-next, it's not reaching a login prompt
with next-20210422.  So I then tried with next-20210419 which
does boot but shows the IOMMU error:

<6>[    2.995341] tegra-dc 54200000.dc: Adding to iommu group 1
<4>[    3.001070] Failed to attached device 54200000.dc to IOMMU_mapping  

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3570052#L1120

The branch I'm using with the patches applied can be found here:

  https://gitlab.collabora.com/gtucker/linux/-/commits/next-20210419-nyan-big-drm-read/

Hope this helps, let me know if you need anything else to be
tested.

Best wishes,
Guillaume
