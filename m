Or maybe convert them to stateless links?  Would that be doable at all?

I would prefer this ->

-> because "fix the warning" really means that we haven't got the
device link state machine right and getting it right may imply a major
redesign.

Overall, I'd prefer to take a step back and allow things to stabilize
for a while to let people catch up with this.
