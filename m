I'm pretty sure I already merged the tegra change in drm-misc-next, so if it's
causing issues you probably should send out a revert for now and I can r-b it
so we can figure out a better solution for this in the mean time

yes we do still need the backpointer - I'm just still working on getting
reviews for some of the other parts of this series, and have been on PTO/busy
with a couple of other things.

Yeah this makes sense for me - I can try to make this change on the next
respin of this series. What kind of setup were you able to reproduce issues on
this with btw?
