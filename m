Since for cursor plane this always returns 0, you could test
tegra_plane_is_cursor() at the start of the function.

Does it matter to which channel (plane) the peak bw is attached? Would
it still work if the first channel specified max(peak_bw of overlaps)
and others only zeroes?

[...]

One point is unexplained yet: why is the multiplier proportional to a
*difference* between src and dst widths? Also, I would expect max (worst
case) is pixclock * read_size when src_w/dst_w >= read_size.

BTW, you could move this below and : if (src > dst_w) peak_bandwidth *= ...
