People that do this will have to do it manually because most
distributions I know of will actually ship the DTBs. If they know how to
update the kernel separately, I'm sure they will manage to update the
DTB as well. It's really not more complicated that updating the kernel
image.

I'm not sure what distribution you have been using, but the ones that
I'm familiar with all install the DTBs along with the kernel. Most Tegra
devices (newer ones at least) do also support booting with U-Boot which
supports standard ways to boot a system (which were co-developed with
distributions precisely so that it would become easier for users to keep
their systems up-to-date), so there's really nothing magical anyone
should need to do in order to get an updated DTB along with the updated
kernel.

It's a simple fact that sometimes a DTB contains a bug and we have to
fix it.

In general we try to fix things up in the driver code when reasonable so
that people don't have to update the DTB. This is for the (mostly hypo-
thetical) case where updating the DTB is not possible or very
complicated.

However, that's not the case on the Venice 2 or Nyan boards. And looking
at the alternative in this case, I don't think it's reasonable compared
to just fixing the problem at the root, which is in the DTB.
