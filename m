That all sounds odd. of_dma_configure_id() already sets up the DMA mask
based on dma-ranges and the DMA API uses that to restrict what IOVA any
buffers can get mapped to for a given device.

Drivers can obviously still narrow down the DMA mask further if they
have any specific needs. On Tegra, for example, we use this to enforce
bus-level DMA masks. The Ethernet controller for instance might support
40 bit addresses, but the memory bus has a quirk where bit 39 is used
for extra "swizzling", so we have to restrict DMA masks to 39 bits for
all devices, regardless of what the drivers claim.

Yeah, that sounds reasonable. If the aperture represents what the IOMMU
supports. Together with each device's DMA mask we should have everything
we need.

For Tegra GART I think there's indeed no use-cases at the moment. Dmitry
had at one point tried to make use of it because it can be helpful on
some of the older devices that were very memory-constrained. That
support never made it upstream because it required significant changes
in various places, if I recall correctly. For anything with a decent
enough amount of RAM, CMA is usually a better option.

This has occasionally come up in the past and I seem to remember that it
had once been proposed to simply remove tegra-gart and there had been no
objections. Adding Dmitry, if he doesn't have objections to remaving it,
neither do I.
