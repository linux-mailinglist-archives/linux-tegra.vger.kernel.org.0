I had a chat with Vidya last night to understand the issue, so now I
have a good understanding of the problem this has caused, which is very
unfortunate indeed!

Vidya mentioned that you would like us to get this backported to stable
branches. Please correct me if I am wrong here. We can certainly do
that, but I do have concerns about doing so, for non-Tegra devices
inparticularly, given that this has been around for sometime now. Hence,
I was wondering if we should leave this soak in the mainline for at
least a kernel release cycle before doing so. I really don't want to
break stable for anyone. What are your thoughts on this?

Cheers
Jon
