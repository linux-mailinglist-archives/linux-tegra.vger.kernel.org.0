Yes, I prefer you need to get this added in the PSCI specification.
I have passed this thread to the author of the specification.

From previous emails, I gather these can be moved to firmware and need not be
there in DT ?

I prefer not to have Tegra specific idle driver if we can get the necessary
changes in PSCI spec. We must then have just one PSCI idle driver in the
kernel.

Correct.
