Pft... you're being unreasonable. These are all relatively trivial
changes that have at one point or another been already reviewed. Do you
seriously expect me to turn these into 7 different patch series so that
everyone gets to spend even more time dealing with these?

It's an extremely trivial, one-line change to an existing binding. There
is no interaction with the driver whatsoever, why would anyone outside
of the DT and Tegra maintainers even want to look at this?

I use get_maintainers.pl but filter down based on common sense.

Again, these are patches that were all on the list previously, sent to
the right people at the time. They hadn't been picked up by now, so I
resent them, to the DT maintainers only, to give you guys a chance to
object in case there were any new things you were looking for since the
original submissions.

You know, I'll do just that. In fact, I'll just stop working on these
cleanup patches. It's a shame because I really wanted to get off your
wall of shame by this year's LPC, but you're making this needlessly
complicated and I'm out of patience.
