Actually, I wonder whether we can have a more general approach:

A partial hierarchy that doesn't have an irq_data->chip pointer 
populated
cannot be valid. So I wonder if the least ugly thing to do is to just 
drop
any messing about in the PMC driver, and instead to let 
__irq_domain_alloc_irqs()
do the culling, always, by looking for a NULL pointer in irq_data->chip.

Not any less ugly, but at least doesn't need any driver intervention.
