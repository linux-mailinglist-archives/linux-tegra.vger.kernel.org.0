Broader in what sense?  They work essentially identically except that
pci_bus_wait_crs() doesn't need a pci_dev * (because it's used during
enumeration when we don't have a pci_dev yet) and it does dword reads
instead of word reads.

It is a shame that the logic is duplicated, but we don't have to worry
about that here.

I think I would stick with pci_dev_wait() in this case since we do
have a pci_dev * and it's a little simpler, unless I'm missing the
advantage of pci_bus_wait_crs().
