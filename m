The "PM: sleep: Resume children after resuming the parent" patch is
unlikely to introduce the issue, so you should not need to revert it.

The issue is probably introduced by "PM: sleep: Suspend async parents
after suspending children".

You need to set CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG to see those (and other debug
attributes).

You may also turn off async suspend altogether:

# echo 0 > /sys/power/pm_async

and see if this helps.

So if it works with async suspend disabled, I would check the ordering
in which devices are suspended in that case (probably requires running
with initcall_debug in the kernel command line and echoing 1 to
/sys/power/pm_debug_messages).

Then compare it to the ordering in which devices are suspended with
async suspend enabled (for that, I would hack the I2C controller
suspend return an error early to avoid having to reboot the board
after it hangs).  All of the differences would be suspicious.
