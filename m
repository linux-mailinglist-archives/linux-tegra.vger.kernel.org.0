AFAIK, all tablet devices starting with Tegra20 that have display panel
are initializing display at a boot time for showing splash screen. This
includes all T20/T30/T114 tablets that are already supported by upstream
kernel.

Yes, my understanding that this is what Robin suggested here:

The reserved-memory indeed shouldn't be needed for resolving the
implicit IOMMU problem since we could mark certain devices within the
kernel IOMMU driver.

I haven't got around to trying to implement the implicit IOMMU support
yet, but I suppose we could implement the def_domain_type() hook in the
SMMU driver and then return IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY for the Display/VDE
devices. Then the Display/VDE drivers will take over the identity domain
and replace it with the explicit domain.

Please note that the reserved-memory approach also creates problem for
selection of a large CMA region if FB is located somewhere in a middle
of DRAM.

I already see that the FB's reserved-memory will break CMA for Nexus 7
and Acer A500 because CMA area overlaps with the bootloader's FB :)

Also keep in mind that initrd needs a location too and location usually
hardwired in a bootloader. Hence it increases pressure on the CMA selection.

Majority of devices in a wild don't use u-boot and they have a
locked-down bootloader. Still it's possible to chain-load u-boot or
bypass the "security" and replace the bootloader, but these approaches
aren't widely supported because they take a lot of effort to be
implemented and maintained.

Even those devices that use proper u-boot usually never updating it and
are running some ancient version. You can't ignore all those people :)

IIRC, in the past Robin Murphy was suggesting to read out hardware state
early during kernel boot in order to find what regions are in use by
hardware.

I think it should be easy to do for the display controller since we
could check clock and PD states in order to decide whether DC's IO could
be accessed and then read out the FB pointer and size. I guess it should
take about hundred lines of code.

But the easiest way should be to ignore this trouble for devices that
have IOMMU disabled by default and simply allow display to show garbage.
Nobody ever complained about this for the past 7+ years :)

Hence implementing the dummy-identity domain support should be enough
for solving the problem, at least this should work for pre-T186 devices.
