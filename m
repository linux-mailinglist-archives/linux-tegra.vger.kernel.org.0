DT expects PCI bridge child nodes to be a PCI device. We've already
broken that with the interrupt controller child nodes, but I don't
really want to add more.

What is the actual usecase and benefit for using the DMA engine with
the RP? The only one I've come up with is the hardware designers think
having DMA is better than not having DMA so they include that option
on the DWC controller.
