Yes, I think that's a better option. Have we ensured that on all systems
where autocal is enabled these values are part of the device tree? Just
making sure that we're not going to have some generation still spit out
these warnings because we forgot to update the device tree.

For example I see that we set NVQUIRK_HAS_PADCALIB but I don't see these
properties being set in arch/arm/boot/dts/tegra30.dtsi. Can you add a
patch that also adds the properties for Tegra30?
