 I skimmed over the Alpha stuff and it seems to mostly care about setting 
the slot value returned differently and defers to `pci_common_swizzle' for 
actual pin determination.  This could be moderately easy to sort out.

 One exception is `takara_swizzle' which looks incomplete to me; as this 
is a PICMG device[1] someone would have to fill in the missing details as 
AFAICT the PICMG connector is supposed to provide all the INT# A-D lines 
and then routing is done on the backplane using binding defined by PICMG.

 According to DEC documentation there's an alternative interrupt routing 
mode available too, using a external interrupt controller FPGA placed on 
the backplane[2], where no swizzling is done and instead each of the four 
INT# lines across all the PCI slots, up to 16, provided by a backplane is 
individually routed to 64 inputs of the interrupt controller.

 There is a paper by DEC available online[3] that could help filling in 
the missing details for either mode, especially someone who has access to 
such a system and could verify it in reality.
