It sounds to me like there are two different interpretations of SRAM and
reserved regions. On one hand, as you suggest, we have one SRAM that's
made available as genalloc pool and then individual regions can be
marked as reserved so that they aren't added to that pool.

At the same time, each reserved region is also exposed as a separate
pool and that's in fact used by many consumers as a way of getting a
specific chunk of the SRAM for their own use (via phandle to the region
=66rom the consumer's device tree node).

In addition to that, the reserved region code doesn't actually fully do
its job because while the reserved region isn't actually added to the
"top-level" SRAM pool, the memory is still mapped. At the same time this
is something that we actually want because, like I mentioned, some of
the consumers do want to get at their SRAM chunks via references to the
partitions.

The problem that this patch series is really trying to solve is another
still: the complete SRAM is always mapped to kernel memory, irrespective
of whether any regions are marked reserved or not and that can cause
speculative accesses to memory outside of the defined regions.

Stephen's suggestion is to default to only mapping memory for which a
partition has been defined in the SRAM and assuming that all SRAM
outside of those partitions is off limits. I think that's a sensible
default and it's unambiguous.

But as Yousaf points out that would break compatibility with existing
device trees. Depending on how you interpret the bindings one could
argue that those device trees are buggy and should have partitions
defined (in the cases I've looked at they end up using a fixed region
anyway, so that could've just been made explicit in the device tree).

However, it also looks like all of the users that rely on the original
behaviour where they can just access the full pool are those that don't
define any reserved regions, whereas all users that do reserve regions
will actually use those reserved regions.

So I think we can make use of this by differentiating in the driver
between SRAM nodes with or without children and change the behaviour
accordingly. I think that has the big advantage that it makes things
work as (I think) most people would expect and doesn't further
complicate the binding with extra flags.
