This is what below reference tried to achieve in the original series, 
where all Mux widgets and corresponding kcontrols were exposed.

However it has DAI declarations too, that was mainly because 
codec-to-codec links were used to connect multiple components. DT would 
expose all these links (please note that machine driver was not sent as 
part of the original series). May be with DPCM these additional DAIs can 
be avoided, but it comes with few challenges highlighted in this RFC patch.
