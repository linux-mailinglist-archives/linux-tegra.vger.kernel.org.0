Not really, there's typically only just one panel. But that's just one
example. EMC would be another. There's only a single EMC on Tegra and
yet for something like interconnects we still reference it by phandle.
PMC is another case and so is CAR, GPIO (at least on early Tegra SoCs)
and pinmux, etc.

The example of GPIO shows very well how this is important. If we had
made the assumption from the beginning that there was only ever going to
be a single GPIO controller, then we would've had a big problem when the
first SoC shipped that had multiple GPIO controllers.

The same is true for the SMMU, and yet the iommus property references
the SMMU by phandle. There are a *lot* of cases where you could imply
dependencies because you have intimate knowledge about the hardware
within drivers. But the point is to avoid this wherever possible so
that the DTB is as self-describing as possible.

It looks like tegra20-devfreq is the only one that currently does this
lookup via compatible string. And looking at the driver, what it does is
pretty horrible, to be honest. It gets a reference to the memory
controller and then simply accesses registers within the memory
controller without any type of protection against concurrent accesses or
reference counting to make sure the registers it accesses are still
valid. At the very least this should've been a regmap. And not
coincidentally, regmaps are usually passed around by referencing their
provider via phandle.

That's exactly the kind of hack that I want to prevent from happening.
If you can just grab a pointer to the memory controller with a global
function pointer it makes people think that it's okay to use this kind
of shortcut. But it isn't.

Given the above, the lookup-by-compatible fallback should stay limited
to tegra20-devfreq. Everything else should move to something saner. So
this new helper should look up by phandle and not have a fallback, but
instead the tegra20-devfreq should fall back if the new helper doesn't
return anything useful (probably something like -ENOENT, meaning that
there's no phandle and that we're using an old device tree). Bonus
points for updating the DT bindings for tegra20-devfreq to also allow
the memory controller to be specified by phandle and use a regmap for
the shared registers.

I strongly disagree. We look up a bunch of devices via phandle, and in
only very rare cases do we care only about the DT node. When we look up
clocks, resets or GPIOs, we always get some sort of resource handle. It
makes sense to do so because we need to operate on these resources and
having only a DT node doesn't allow us to do that.

Ultimately this is a matter of principle. Yes, it's true that there is
only a single MC on Tegra and we can "cheat" by taking advantage of that
knowledge. But we don't have to, and it's not even very difficult to not
rely on that knowledge. Treating the MC differently from everything else
also makes it more difficult to understand the associated code and on
top of that it sets a bad example because other people seeing this code
will think it's a good idea.

The big advantage of uniformity is that it drastically simplifies things
and causes less suprises.
