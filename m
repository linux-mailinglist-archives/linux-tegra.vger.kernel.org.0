It's possible that the second call uses different parameters. Don't make 
the assumption that the parameters are exactly the same between FEs, see 
more below.

prepare() is a different stage, you shouldn't assume that the transition 
between hw_params() and prepare() is immediate.

You could have two FEs that try to configure different parameters, i.e. 
S16LE or S32LE before the prepare stage is reached. Not to mention that 
sound servers such as PulseAudio or PipeWire do make repeated calls to 
hw_params() with different configurations to figure out what is 
supported, i.e. prepare() and trigger() stages are not reached.

Note that the DPCM logic is far from perfect, in the case of shared BEs 
the hw_params should not be propagated from FEs. In the case of a mixer, 
it would be very useful to have a boundary between FE and BE, with the 
mixer pre-configured to e.g. 48kHz S32LE. The existing propagation from 
FE to BE can be problematic in that the last configuration will be 
retained, and that's not necessarily the highest resolution. We had 
similar problems in the past when we tried to be smart with PulseAudio 
and automatically select 44.1kHz or 48 kHz. That causes all kinds of 
issues where the change of configuration only happens when all streams 
are idle, and while a stream is active the configuration cannot be 
reconfigured. It's much simpler to decide what the BE settings are once 
and not try to adapt.

In other words, the existing logic is fine, only redundant in the case 
of *identical* hw_params for all streams feeding into a common BE. I 
don't feel it's worth changing for now, if we change something in the 
logic that should be a bigger change to add constraints between domains, 
and allow for more than two domains.
