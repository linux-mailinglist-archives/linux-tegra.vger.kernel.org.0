To make this more concrete, where specifically is this delay?

That doesn't say we must wait 1s; it only says we can't decide the
device is broken before 1s.  But regardless, I agree that the CRS
handling doesn't belong in the driver for either the endpoint or the
PCIe host controller.

My question is whether this wait should be connected somehow with
platform_pci_set_power_state().  It sounds like the tegra host
controller driver already does the platform-specific delays, and I'm
not sure it's reasonable for platform_pci_set_power_state() to do the
CRS polling.  Maybe something like this?  I'd really like to get
Rafael's thinking here.

pci_bus_wait_crs() does an exponential backoff, i.e., it does reads
after 0ms, 2ms, 4ms, 8ms, ..., 512ms, 1024ms, so we don't know
*exactly* when the device became ready.  All we know is that it
became ready somewhere between 512ms and 1024ms.

But 821cdad5c46c ("PCI: Wait up to 60 seconds for device to become
ready after FLR") does suggest that the Intel 750 NVMe may require
more than 1s.  I think the 60s timeout is just a convenient large
number and I'm not sure it's derived from anything in the spec.
