Right, I did ponder the idea of a whole programmatic 
"request_context_irq" hook that would allow registering the handler for 
both interrupts with the appropriate context bank and instance data, but 
since all interrupts are currently unexpected it seems somewhat hard to 
justify the extra complexity. Obviously we can revisit this in future if 
you want to start actually doing something with faults like the qcom GPU 
folks do.
