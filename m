The SDIO PINCTRL drive-strengths are usually a part of the board's
default PINCTRL state, which is either preset by bootloader or by
PINCTRL driver early at a boot time.

The SDIO drive-strengths values should be board-specific and not
SoC-specific because they should depend on the electrical properties of
the board, IIUC.

If the SDIO PINCTRL states are mandatory for the SDHCI nodes in the
device-trees, then the DT binding is wrong since it says that all
properties are optional. But I think that the current binding is okay,
since today SDHCI PINCTRL drive-strengths are specified implicitly in
the device-trees, and thus, there is no real need to emit the noisy
warnings in this case.
