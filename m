I assume that it would be OK for the sample rate converter itself to
expose mixer controls to configure its input and output rates so the
user could configure as needed?

I can see that in most cases there are a finite set of configurations
that the end user may use. However, we would like to make the
configuration flexible as possible and this also allow us to test lots
of different configurations for verification purposes as well.

So a typical scenario would be ...

DMIC --> SRC --> DMA

Where SRC is the sample-rate converter. Now, the DMICs support upto
48kHz and although it maybe unlikely that someone would want to up
convert to say 96kHz, it is possible we can do this with the SRC.

So if the user executes arecord with '-r 96000', the DMIC hw_params
would return an error as this is not supported. So today we override
this. However, the best solution would be to allow the user the set the
input of the SRC and then if the DMIC output is routed via the SRC use
the SRC input rate instead of the actual rate seen/specified by the
user. So like you said in your other mail, if we could propagate the
rate information that would be ideal.
