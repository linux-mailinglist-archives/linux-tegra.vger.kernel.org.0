Right.

Why exactly do you want to do that ? Rather you should provide
online/offline hooks for the cpufreq driver and do light-weight
suspend/resume as is done by cpufreq-dt.c as well.

Hmm, okay.

You were getting the message during resume as well ? Why ? The
firmware is updating the frequency to a previous value ? If that is
so, you should just set the frequency again to some other value during
resume to fix it.
