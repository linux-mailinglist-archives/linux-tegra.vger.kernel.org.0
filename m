Hi Prakash,

> Tegra194 implements suspend_noirq() hook and during the system suspend, the link
> is taken to L2 state after PME_Turn_off handshake and if it doesn't go into L2,
> PERST# is asserted. It is observed that with some of the endpoints (Ex:- Marvell
> SATA controller), the link doesn't go into L2 state and asserting PERST# results
> in Surprise Link Down error and the corresponding AER interrupt is also raised.
> Since the system is in noirq phase, this interrupt is not served. Both PME and
> AER interrupts are served by the same wire interrupt in Tegra194, and since the
> PCIe sub-system enables wake capability for PME interrupt, having a pending AER
> interrupt is treated as PME wake interrupt by the system and prevents the system
> going into the suspend state. To address this issue, the interrupts are disabled
> before taking the link into L2 state as the interrupts are not expected anyway
> from the controller afterward.

This commit could use some formatting, perhaps splitting it into few
paragraphs and also I believe your line length could use some
adjustment.  Having said that, I am not sure if the whole detailed
account of the problem is required to be included here in the commit
message.

This code comment added below makes for a better commit message that the
commit message above - clear, concise and straight to the point of why
this was added.
