Partially you answered here. :) Since you should not pull my branch into
a DT branch, you also should not put these include/dt-bindings patches
there.  SoC guys will complain about this as well.

These patches are also needed for the driver, so if you take them, I
would need them back in a pull request. SoC folks could spot it as well
and point that such merge should not happen.

Yeah, that's a known problem. I asked about this Arnd and Olof in the
past and got reply with two solutions:
1. Apply current version of patch without defines, just hard-coded
   numbers. After merging to Linus, replace the numbers with defines.

2. Wait with DTS till dependencies reach Linus.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
