If we move to single clock now, it need one more additional fallback=20
implementation in audio driver during parent configuration as=20
clk_out_1_mux will not be there with single clock change and old/current=20
kernel has it as it uses separate clocks for pmc mux and gate.

Also, with single clock for both PMC mux and gate now, new DT should use=20
extern1 as parent to CLK_OUT_1 as CLK_OUT_1_MUX will not be there old=20
PMC dt-bindings has separate clocks for MUX (CLK_OUT_1_MUX) and gate=20
(CLK_OUT_1)

DT bindings will not be compatible b/w old and new changes if we move to=20
Single PMC clock now.

Should we go with same separate clocks to have it compatible to avoid=20
all this?
