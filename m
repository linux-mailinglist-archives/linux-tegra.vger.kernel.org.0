I think the above commit log is perfectly accurate, but all the
details might suggest that this is something specific to rockchip or
CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ, which it isn't, and they might obscure the
fundamental problem, which is actually very simple: we registered IRQ
handlers before we were ready for them to be called.

I propose the following commit log in the hope that it would help
other driver authors to make similar fixes:

    PCI: rockchip: Register IRQ handlers after device and data are ready

    An IRQ handler may be called at any time after it is registered, so
    anything it relies on must be ready before registration.

    rockchip_pcie_subsys_irq_handler() and rockchip_pcie_client_irq_handler()
    read registers in the PCIe controller, but we registered them before
    turning on clocks to the controller.  If either is called before the clocks
    are turned on, the register reads fail and the machine hangs.

    Similarly, rockchip_pcie_legacy_int_handler() uses rockchip->irq_domain,
    but we installed it before initializing irq_domain.

    Register IRQ handlers after their data structures are initialized and
    clocks are enabled.

If this is inaccurate or omits something important, let me know.  I
can make any updates locally.
