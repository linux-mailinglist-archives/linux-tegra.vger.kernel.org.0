I did most of this work a long time ago and L4T just wasn't ready yet to
make use of all this cleanup potential. We can probably go find most of
the code and it might still be largely applicable.

It's a bit disappointing that this didn't go anywhere for the longest
time and all of a sudden most of it just seems to be irrelevant.
