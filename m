I don't think that's an unintended side-effect. If the property
validates against a schema it counts as evaluated, doesn't it? In order
to avoid that we would somehow have to restrict which schemas contribute
to the evaluatedProperties annotation and I don't think there's a way to
do that because we don't know which out of all the schemas is relevant.

Okay, I see your point.

Okay, I'll give the first option a try and see where I end up.

Yes, I think I understand now.
