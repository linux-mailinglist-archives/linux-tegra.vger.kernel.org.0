My bad, it doesn't work at all. I actually need to use the rpm_pstate or
something else because performance state is coupled with the enable
state of the device. If device is never rpm-suspended by consumer
driver, then the initialized performance state is never dropped. Hence I
want to initialize the state which is set only when device is resumed.

I'll need to think more about it.
