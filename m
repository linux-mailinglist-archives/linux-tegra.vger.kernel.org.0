The problem that Manikanta is trying to solve here occurs in this
situation (Manikanta, correct me if I've got this wrong): on some
setups, a WiFi module connected over PCI will toggle a power GPIO as
part of runtime suspend. This effectively causes the module to disappear
=66rom the PCI bus (i.e. it can no longer be accessed until the power GPIO
is toggled again).

This is fine from a kernel point of view because the kernel keeps track
of what devices are suspended. However, userspace will occasionally try
to read the configuration space access of all devices, and since it
doesn't have any knowledge about the suspend state of these devices, it
doesn't know which ones to leave alone. I think this happens when the
X.Org server is running.

One thing that Manikanta and I had discussed was that perhaps the device
should be hot-unplugged when it goes into this low-power state. However,
we don't support hotplug on Tegra210 where this is needed, so we'd need
some sort of software-induced hot-unplug. However, this low power state
is entered when the WiFi interface is taken down (i.e. ip link set dev
<interface> down). If we were to remove the PCI device in that case, it
means that the interface goes away completely, which is completely
unexpected from a user's perspective. After all, taking a link down and
up may be something that scripts are doing all the time. They'd fall
over if after taking the interface down, the interface completely
disappears.

It's also not entirely clear to me how we get the device back onto the
bus again after it is in low power. If we hot-unplug the device, then
the driver will be unbound. Presumably the driver is what's controlling
the power GPIO, so there won't be any entity that can be used to bring
the chip back to life. Unless we deal with that power GPIO elsewhere
(rfkill switch perhaps?).

Perhaps one other way to deal with this would be to track the suspend
state of devices and then have the code that implements the PCI access
=66rom userspace refuse accesses to devices that are asleep. I suppose
this is somewhat of an odd use-case because traditionally I guess PCI
devices never power down to a state where their configuration space can
no longer be accessed. At least that's what would explain why this has
never been an issue before. Or perhaps it has?

The last resort would be to just never put the WiFi chip into that low
power mode, though I'm not exactly sure what that means for the power
consumption on the affected systems.

Manikanta, can you fill in some of the blanks above?
