During boot, want to set the frequency from freq_table which is closest 
to the one set by bootloader.
During resume from suspend-to-idle, want to restore the frequency which 
was set on non-boot cores before they were hotplug powered off.

We want to avoid the warning messages.

The cpufreq core change will help in bootup case but not during the case 
of resume.
In this change, reading the previously stored value and restoring it 
will also fix the warning message during resume.
