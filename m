Actually there are a couple of interesting clocksources that this IP
block exposes. It contains both a microsecond clock that might come in
useful because it is used as a reference by some other blocks that work
with microsecond counters (some hardware sequencers have this). Another
one is the OSC, which is the system's main oscillator that most clocks
are derived from.

Perhaps the most useful source from a software point of view is the TSC.
It's a timestamp counter that can also be used as a reference for HW
timestamping of certain system events, which is something that we want
to upstream eventually. Having the TSC exposed as a clocksource can be
interesting because it allows us to correlate these hardware timestamps
with code path execution.

I've implemented the three clocksources above for v2, which makes this a
bit more of an actual clocksource driver that additionally provides a
watchdog.
