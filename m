Yes, I'm telling that this should be a wrong thing to do.

Again, clk_get() should return -EPROBE_DEFER until provider is registered.

CPU load doesn't reflect the memory usage.

1. CPU could be 100% loaded while not making memory accesses at all
(100% cache hit).

2. CPU governor settings could be changed by user and CPU != memory.

ACTMON is specifically designated to memory scaling based on actual
memory usage statistics. T210 ACTMON is similar to T124, it should be
easy to support.

Up to you then :)
