This is true, but only if all these words are applied to the generic APIs.

Regmap is about abstracting accesses to devices that may sit on
different types of buses, like I2C or SPI for example. Or devices that
have a non-trivial registers mapping, or have slow IO and need caching.

I think you meant regmap in regards to protecting IO accesses, but this
is not what regmap is about if IO accesses are atomic by nature.

The tegra20-devfreq functionality is very separated from the rest of the
memory controller, hence there are no conflicts in regards to hardware
accesses, so there is nothing to protect.

Also, Regmap API itself doesn't manage refcounting of the mappings.

Any real-world examples? I think you're mixing up regmap with something
else.

The devfreq driver works just like the SMMU and GART. The devfreq device
is supposed to be created only once both MC and EMC drivers are loaded
and we know that they can't go away [1].

[1]
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-tegra/patch/20200814000621.8415-32-digetx@gmail.com/

Hence the tegra20-devfreq driver is horrible as much as the SMMU and
GART drivers. Perhaps not much could be done about it unless MC driver
is converted to MFD. But MFD won't work for tegra20-devfreq driver
anyways because it depends on presence of both MC and EMC drivers
simultaneously :)

Besides you didn't want the MFD couple years ago [2].

The tegra20-devfreq driver doesn't share registers with other drivers.
MC statistics collection is a part of the MC, but it has no connection
to the other functions of the MC, at least from SW perspective.

Apparently you're missing that it's still not a problem to change the
T20 DT because all the MC-related drivers are still inactive in the
upstream kernel and awaiting the interconnect support addition.

Secondly, you're missing that tegra30-devfreq driver will also need to
perform the MC lookup [3] and then driver will no longer work for the
older DTs if phandle becomes mandatory because these DTs do not have the
MC phandle in the ACTMON node.

[3]
https://github.com/grate-driver/linux/commit/441d19281f9b3428a4db1ecb3a02e1ec02a8ad7f

So we will need the fall back for T30/124 as well.

We don't have this problem because MC drivers do not support unloading.
Hence this is not something to really care about for now.

Maybe MC drivers won't ever support unloading and then why do we need to
discuss it at all? Should be better to get back to this once there will
be a real need.

But we aren't talking about the uniformity, at least I'm not.

To be honest, it feels to me that you're talking from perspective of
yours generic memory controller API series and want to see everything
tailored for it, which is okay :)

While I'm merely wanting to improve the existing codebase with minimal
efforts and without a need to change DTs.

Alright, I'll consider to add the phandles as a part of the interconnect
series since you're so concentrated on it :) But the series is already
40+ patches.. although, the vast majority of the patches are very
trivial, so maybe okay to add couple more trivial patches. I'm very
hoping that you will manage to allocate time for reviewing of the
upcoming v6 and that it will be good for merging into to the v5.11!
