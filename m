I've had a closer look at this and it seems you're messing around
with the clock of the codec's node (which is _not_ a subnode of
the simple-audio-card). I don't think this is correct.

I guess you should rather set the clock property in the codec
subnode of the simple-audio-card, which is then picked up by the
simple-audio-card driver and changed accordingly.

For example:
		simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			bitclock-master = <&dailink0_master>;
			frame-master = <&dailink0_master>;
			format = "i2s";

			cpu {
				sound-dai = <&sai6>;
			};

			dailink0_master: codec {
				sound-dai = <&wm8904>;
				clocks = <&mclk>;
			};
		};

In this case mclk will be enabled and disabled accordingly.

Could you test this?
