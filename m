What about sprinkling tons of device_links all over this to make sure
system suspend/resume is done in the same order too? Slightly less
neat from a driver pov, but I think that should get the job done.
Maybe could even do a convenience function which converts a dt phandle
(or whatever that was called again) into a device_link?
