I'm asking this question because right now there is only one potential
client for this IOCTL, the VIC. If other clients aren't supposed to be a
part of the DRM driver, like for example NVDEC which probably should be
a V4L driver, then DRM driver will have only a single VIC and in this
case we shouldn't need this IOCTL because DRM and V4L should use generic
dmabuf API for importing and exporting buffers.

I'm also not quite sure about whether the current model of the unified
Tegra DRM driver is suitable for having the separated engines. Perhaps
each separated engine should just have its own rendering node?
