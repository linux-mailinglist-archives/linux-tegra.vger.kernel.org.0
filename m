I think Lukasz's point is that you can encode the predicted idle time by
having multiple idle_state entries with different min_residency mapping
to the same actual idle-state. So you would several variants of C6 with
different min_residencies and if the OS picks one with longer
min_residency firmware would have a better estimate of the predicted
idle residency.

I'm not convinced it is the right way to work around passing this
information on to firmware. I would rather see an example of how well
this works (best with numbers) and have a proper solution.
