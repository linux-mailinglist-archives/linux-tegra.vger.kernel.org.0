Depends on the perspective.

How about something like this:

Turn the syncpt_incr field back into an array of structs like

#define DRM_TEGRA_SUBMIT_SYNCPT_INCR_REPLACE_SYNCOBJ		(1<<0)
#define DRM_TEGRA_SUBMIT_SYNCPT_INCR_PATCH_DYNAMIC_SYNCPT	(1<<1)

struct drm_tegra_submit_syncpt_incr {
	/* can be left as zero if using dynamic syncpt */
	__u32 syncpt_id;
	__u32 flags;

	struct {
		__u32 syncobj;
		__u32 value;
	} fence;

	/* patch word as such:
          * *word = *word | (syncpt_id << shift)
          */
	struct {
		__u32 gather_offset_words;
		__u32 shift;
	} patch;
};

So this will work similarly to the buffer reloc system; the kernel 
driver will allocate a job syncpoint and patch in the syncpoint ID if 
requested, and allows outputting syncobjs for each increment.
