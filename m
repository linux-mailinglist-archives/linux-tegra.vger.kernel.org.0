currently, audio mclk and its parent clocks enabling are from clock=20
driver init and not from tegra_asoc_utils_init.

plla rate change through tegra_asoc_utils_set_rate() happens only when=20
there is not active playback or record corresponding to this sound device.

So, I don't see reason for disabling clock during rate change and not=20
sure why we had this from the beginning.

Thierry/Sameer,

Can you please comment?

Yes, we can use CLK_SET_RATE_GATE for PLLA and remove clock disabling=20
before rate change.
