Yup. It is indeed doing it as part of pci_power_up() in pci.c file.
But, what is confusing to me is the order of the calls.
pci_power_up() has following calls in the same order.
	pci_raw_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0);
	pci_update_current_state(dev, PCI_D0);
But, pci_raw_set_power_state() is accessing config space without calling
pci_device_is_present() whereas pci_update_current_state() which is called
later in the flow is calling pci_device_is_present()...!

Following is the path in resume() flow.
