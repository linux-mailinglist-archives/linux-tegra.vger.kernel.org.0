After some searching (which I should have done sooner, so
apologies) I came across a teardown of the Pixel C ([1], for completeness),
which incorporates this panel. Indeed a separate touch controller was found,
so it seems the downstream kernel threw me off as per your warning.

Noted, I will remove it from the binding in the next version.

The relevant part of the DTS can be found here:
