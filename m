Hello, Michał! Thank you very much for taking a look at the patch!

Each display plane has individual memory client on Tegra, memory ICC
paths are specified per memory client. This is how memory ICCs are
defined in the DT binding and that's what memory drivers are expecting
to deal with. It is also nice to see in ICC debugfs how much memory
bandwidth is consumed by each individual memory client.

The algorithm assumes that we have a fixed number of planes to care
about and it's not executed in a hot code path, hence it's more optimal
to have a simpler and smaller code rather than try to optimize it
without gaining any benefits, IMO.

The CCF discards dummy rate-changes in the end of ICC code path.
Besides, we're not performing it in a hot code paths, hence performance
isn't a concern in this patch.

The tegra_crtc_update_memory_bandwidth() relies on being called before
and after the atomic commit. For example CRTC's "active" state is
updated only after the completion of commit-tail phase.

Earlier versions of this patch had checks that tried to avoid setting
bandwidth in both 'begin' and 'end' phases of a commit, but then I found
that it was buggy in regards to DPMS handling and it was much more
optimal to remove the unnecessary "optimizations" since code was blowing
up in complexity when I tried to fix it.

The tegra_crtc_update_memory_bandwidth() still checks whether old BW =
new BW, hence in practice actual ICC changes are only performed when
plane is turned on/off.

Good catch, thank you!

The 'check' in the name is intended to show that function belongs to
atomic-state checking.

But tegra_plane_calculate_memory_bandwidth_state() also is a good
variant. I'll consider the renaming, thanks!

The hardware isn't optimized for downscale, it indeed takes more
bandwidth. You'll witness a severe underflow of plane's memory FIFO
buffer on trying to downscale 1080p plane to 50x50. It's more optimal to
make a 2d blit to intermediate framebuffer for a large downscales.

Looks like indeed it should be good to add a round-up, thanks.

The maximum index should always stay 6 for older h/w. It should be fine
to add extra sanity check to prevent an explicit misuse of the function,
just in a case. Thank you for the suggestion.
