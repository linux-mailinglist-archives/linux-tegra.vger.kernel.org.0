I see.

Do all three commits need to be reverted to make things work again?
The first one only touches the resume path, so it would be surprising
if it caused a suspend regression to occur.

The most likely commit to cause this issue to happen is the second one
because it effectively changes the suspend ordering for "async"
devices.

So are the devices in question "async"?  To check this, please see the
"async" attribute in the "power" subdirectory of the sysfs device
directory for each of them.

If they are "async", you can write "disable" to this attribute to turn
them into "sync" devices.  I'd do this and see what happens.

Overall, it looks like some dependencies aren't properly represented
by device links on this platform.

Thanks, Rafael
