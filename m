I always thought it was best to be explicit.

Great.  But don't tell me that.  You need to tell the next person who
reads this code, and the next, and the next.  Defines work best for
this.  Comments are also okay.

"Operation not supported on transport endpoint" doesn't seem like a
good fit here.  If the check says, please consider changing it to
something like -EINVAL.

What?  Read from I2C a few times, then sleep sounds like a pretty
common pattern to me.

Thanks.  Hopefully with a bit more information as to why the firmware
expects to see them.  Hopefully they're not random.
