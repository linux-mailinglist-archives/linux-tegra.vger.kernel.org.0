Hmm..okay..that is quite convincing then...

I was saying to have a global parent_driver pointer: similar to
my v1, yet rather than "extern" the tegra_mc_driver, we pass it
through egra_smmu_probe() and store it in a static global value
so as to call tegra_smmu_get_by_fwnode() in ->probe_device().

Though I agree that creating a global device pointer (mc) might
be controversial, yet having a global parent_driver pointer may
not be against the rule, considering that it is common in iommu
drivers to call driver_find_device_by_fwnode in probe_device().

Hmm..I don't quite get the meaning of:
"it isn't known at that point whether MC really is the SMMU".

Are you saying the stage of bus_set_iommu()? So because at that
point either SMMU probe() or MC probe() hasn't finished yet?

Thanks!
