I am seeing following kernel crash on Jetson TX2. Board is flashed with
firmware bits from L4T R32.4.2 with upstream u-boot. Crash always
happens while decompressing initrd. Initrd is approximately 80 MiB in
size and compressed with xz (xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=32MiB).
Crash is not observed if the same initrd is compressed with gzip.
[1] was a previous attempt to workaround the same issue.

With some debugging aid ported from Nvidia downstream kernel [2] the
actual cause was found:

IIUC, there was read request for 0x30039e80 from EL1/2 which failed.
This address falls in the sysram security aperture and hence a read
from normal mode failed.

sysram is mapped at 0x3000_0000 to 0x3004_ffff and is managed by the
sram driver (drivers/misc/sram.c). There are two reserved pools for
BPMP driver communication at 0x3004_e000 and 0x3004_f000 of 0x1000
bytes each.

sram driver maps complete 0x3000_0000 to 0x3004_ffff range as normal
memory. However, only the BPMP reserved pools (0x3004_e000 - 0x3004_ffff)
are accessible from the kernel. Address 0x3003_9e80 is inaccessible
from the kernel and a read to it (which I believe is speculative)
causes the SError. Only driver which uses sysram is not initialized at
this point (rootfs_initcall level). As since
commit d70f5e541ab3 ("firmware: tegra: Make BPMP a regular driver")
bpmp driver is initialized at device_initcall level.

If none of the drivers on the kernel side using 0x3003_9e80 address
range. Why a read to it occurs even speculatively? Could it be that
some EL3 software didnâ€™t cleanup after itself properly? Any
suggestions on debugging this issue further?

Another solution suggested in [1] was to add no-memory-wc in sysram
node in device-tree so that sysram is mapped as device-memory. Thus
preventing any speculative access. However, it causes another set of
issues with the bpmp driver. That's may be a discussion for another
time.
