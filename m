I think the important one is the following which is called from inside
pci_update_current_state() function.

drivers/pci/pci.c:935:      !pci_device_is_present(dev)) {

I've put a dump_stack() to see how this is called and following is the trace

With 0 sec wait, I see issue with Intel 750 NVMe card. As I mentioned above,
it is called from the PCI-PM subsystem which is where the timeout is required.
