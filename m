It seems odd at least and probably broken if it adverises MSI interrupts,
but than doesn't actually support them fully.

Maybe in your current particular case this is true, but in general
we see more and more systems with different kind of root ports, and
having a driver set a global variable due to its own hardwares quirk
defeats that.  So the right thing here is to replace the global
flag with a per-device one first before setting it for a driver.
