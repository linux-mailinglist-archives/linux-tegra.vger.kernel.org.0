If RPM is broken, it probably would have been caught during device usage.
I will remove explicit suspend here if no any concerns from other folks.=20
Thanks.

consider this example,
----
unsigned int x =3D 5;
int y =3D -1;

(x > y) is false.

Hence should be careful while using signed and unsigned comparisons.

Yes true.

will update.
