dt binding doc we have is common for MMC, SD and SDIO of all Tegras. Its=20
not mandatory to have both 3v3 and 1v8 in device tree as based on signal=20
mode.

As these driver strengths are SoC specific, they are part of Tegra SoC=20
specific device tree where same values will be applicable to all Tegra=20
SoC specific platforms.

Based on interface usage on platform, we use one or both of them like=20
sdcard supports dual voltage and we use both 3V3 and 1V8 but if same=20
interface is used for WIFI SD we use 1V8 only.

So made these dt properties as optional.

Other reason they are optional is, Tegra210 and prior has drive strength=20
settings part of apb_misc and Tegra186 and later has driver strengths=20
part of SDMMC controller. So,

- Pinctrls "sdmmc-3v3-drv" and "sdmmc-1v8-drv" for driver strengths are=20
applicable for Tegra210 and prior.
- dt properties pad-autocal-pull-up/down-offset-1v8/3v3-timeout are for=20
T186 onwards for driver strengths

Looks like dt binding doc need fix to clearly document these based on=20
SoC or agree with Yaml we can conditionally specify pinctrl or dt=20
properties based on SoC dependent.

As drive strengths are through dt properties for T186 and later and thru=20
pinctrl for T210 and prior, driver first checks for dt autocal timeout=20
pull-up/down properties and if they are not found, it then checks for=20
presence of pinctrl_state_xyx_drv only when valid pinctrl_state_xyz is=20
present.

Driver expects either pinctrl or dt properties and shows warning when=20
neither of them are present as its mandatory to use fixed driver=20
strengths when auto calibration fails.
