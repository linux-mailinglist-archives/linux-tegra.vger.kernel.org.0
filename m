See the paragraph

 * The contents of the object pointed to are preserved up to the
 * lesser of the new and old sizes (__GFP_ZERO flag is effectively ignored)=
.=20

which confused me into thinking the memory that is being reallocated is
guaranteed to be preserved so it would be returned if the larger size
failed. I suppose there's nothing to fix in the kernel-doc, just my
understanding of that paragraph. Maybe it should say

	The __GFP_ZERO flag is effectively ignored as the contents of
	the objected pointed to @p are preserved up to the lesser of the
	@new_size and old size.
