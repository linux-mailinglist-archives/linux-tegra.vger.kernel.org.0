My understanding is that we want pcie-tegra194.c to be:

  - Built into the kernel when CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194=m or =y and
    CONFIG_ACPI=y and CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS=y.  If we're using the ACPI
    pci_root.c driver, we must have the MCFG quirk built-in, and this
    case worked as I expected (this is on x86):

      $ grep -E "CONFIG_(ACPI\>|PCI_QUIRKS|PCIE_TEGRA194)" .config
      CONFIG_ACPI=y
      CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS=y
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194=y
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194_HOST=m
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194_EP=y

      $ rm drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-tegra194.*o
      $ make drivers/pci/controller/dwc/
	...
	CC      drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-tegra194.o
	AR      drivers/pci/controller/dwc/built-in.a

  - Built as a module when CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194=m and CONFIG_ACPI is
    not set.  In this case, we're not using the ACPI pci_root.c
    driver, and we don't need the MCFG quirk built-in, so it should be
    OK to build a module, and IIUC this patch is supposed to *allow*
    that.  But in my testing, it did *not* build a module.  Am I
    missing something?

      $ grep -E "CONFIG_(ACPI\>|PCI_QUIRKS|PCIE_TEGRA194)" .config
      # CONFIG_ACPI is not set
      # CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS is not set
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194=y
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194_HOST=m
      CONFIG_PCIE_TEGRA194_EP=y

      $ rm drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-tegra194.*o
      $ make drivers/pci/controller/dwc/
	...
	CC      drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-tegra194.o
	AR      drivers/pci/controller/dwc/built-in.a

This was all done with V3 of the patch, but I'm responding to V2 to
continue the conversation there since I don't think this part changed.
