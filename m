Now I see what you did, thanks.

You renamed only the T124 timings here. This is similar to another patch
where you partially removed the reg-shift, which is incorrect to do.

If you'll split this patch into two and rename all the timings
consistently in a separate patch, then I'll be happy. Please note that
you'll also have to change the new DTs if you're going to take them into
5.17.
