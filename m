There isn't much documentation, apart from what exists in the TRMs. But 
basically, syncpoints are an array of 32-bit unsigned integers in 
hardware, with each 32-bit value having the following fundamental 
operations:

* Increment by one, wrapping (i.e. mod 2^32)
* Wait for value to reach threshold, such that if you consider the 32 
bit unsigned integers a circle, then the half-circle preceding 
(integer-wise) the threshold value are considered to be in the past and 
the half-circle succeeding are considered to be in the future. For 
example, if we specify threshold 0xffffffff then 0x0 is considered to be 
one increment in the future. Waits can be done either by HW stalling 
host1x channels (similar to DMA) or CPU interrupts.

If not in the TRM, then no.

The old code used to have hard-coded syncpoint IDs for each use, but now 
we allocate dynamically. This is a global namespace so you need to call 
host1x_syncpt_request to get an ID that is not colliding with anyone else.

- request/put -- allocate and free syncpoint
- incr/wait -- as described before
- incr_max -- when syncpoint is used with host1x channels, used to 
indicate to job tracking code how many times the job will increment the 
syncpoint. when not using channels, should not be used -- looks like the 
tegra210 code calls this a couple of times but it probably shouldn't be 
doing that.

This means that the syncpoint's value did not reach the specified 
threshold. Either the specified threshold is incorrect, or the engine 
did not increment the syncpoint (or did not increment sufficient number 
of times), either because the syncpoint increment was not programmed 
correctly, or the condition for the increment was not fulfilled (i.e. 
the engine got stuck for whatever reason).

Apart from the wait, you can use /sys/kernel/debug/tegra-host1x/status 
to track syncpoint value. Apart from that, if you're not using channels, 
you'll just have to look at engine registers to see why it's not processing.
