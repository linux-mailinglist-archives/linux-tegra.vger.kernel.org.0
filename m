This code operates on the host controller.  It configures the bridge
that leads *to* PCI devices.  Since that bridge is not a PCI device,
the PCI specs don't say anything about how to program it.

The fact that the host controller programming interface happens to
resemble the PCI programming interface is purely coincidental.

Maybe something like this?

    These interfaces resemble the pci_find_*capability() interfaces,
    but these are for configuring host controllers, which are bridges
    *to* PCI devices but are not PCI devices themselves.
