LUT is "Lookup Table" which provides "hardware frequency request" as a 
function of voltage. For each frequency, the table can have multiple 
voltages based on temperature. The table is maintained in "BPMP R5".

Long delay value is used to have the observation window long enough for 
correctly reconstructing the CPU frequency considering noise.
In next patch version, changed delay value to 500us which in our tests 
is considered reliable.

ok. Updated the policy to be per cluster now.

Yes, frequency table is per cluster.

Yes, all clusters are capable to run at different frequencies.
