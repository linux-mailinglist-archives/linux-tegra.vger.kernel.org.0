Hmm, good point, it really depends on what the device wants - even if it 
is coherent, we don't necessarily know how it intends to use any 
particular reservation; allowing MSI writes or similar to allocate in a 
system cache wouldn't go too well, for instance.

Empirically, making the wrong assumption in this area can lead to people 
preferring to spend a year being unfairly rude on Twitter instead of 
providing timely productive feedback :(

I mean the compatibles of the reserved-memory nodes themselves. 
Semantically that should be the perfect way to identify their individual 
purposes, but in practice does mean that we might end up with a big 
match table to say that e.g. "apple,framebuffer" is relaxable and wants 
IOMMU_CACHE, and so on, and old kernels still have to have some default 
behaviour for new things they don't understand. It's not *too* far off 
the general situation for drivers, so if we expect these to be fairly 
rare, maybe that's OK? Particularly if it might be feasible to have some 
semi-generic compatibles to encapsulate the most common behaviours? I'm 
inclined to defer to Rob and Frank on this one.

Indeed, as long as the binding is good from the outset, we can fill in 
support for the more specialised cases as and when.

Thanks,
Robin.
