I think involving state objects and the like is just going to make
it harder to share code between all drivers, if that is the goal.
Just a few tiny helpers I think is what would allow the broadest 
reuse. I guess you could build additional midlayer on top of those
for some drivers if you wish.

As for the bus_format stuff, that looks at the same time overkill,
and insufficiently documented. I guess its main purpose is to exactly
defines how some digtal bus works, which makes sense when you're
chaining a bunch of random chips together. But looks overly complicated
to me for defining what to output from a HDMI encoder. Looking at the
defines I wouldn't even know what to use for HDMI actually. All we
really want is RGB 4:4:4 vs. YCbCr 4:4:4 vs. YCbCr 4:2:2 vs. YCbCr 4:2:0.
Beyond that level of detail we don't care how each bit gets transferred
etc. Hence enum intel_output_format in i915.
