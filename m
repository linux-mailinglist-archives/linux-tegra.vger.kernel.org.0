Here, I'm exercising suspend-to-RAM sequence and the PCIe endpoint of
concern is Intel 750 NVMe drive.
PCIe host controller driver already has 100ms of delay as per the spec,
but this particular device is taking 1023ms to get ready to respond to
configuration space requests (till that time, it responds with
configuration request retry statuses)
I've put a dump_stack () to see the path resume sequence takes and here it is

  Call trace:
   dump_backtrace+0x0/0x158
   show_stack+0x14/0x20
   dump_stack+0xb0/0xf4
   pci_bus_generic_read_dev_vendor_id+0x19c/0x1a0

   pci_update_current_state+0x68/0xd8
   pci_power_up+0x40/0x50
   pci_pm_resume_noirq+0x7c/0x138
   dpm_run_callback.isra.16+0x20/0x70
   device_resume_noirq+0x120/0x238
   async_resume_noirq+0x24/0x58
   async_run_entry_fn+0x40/0x148
   process_one_work+0x1e8/0x360
   worker_thread+0x40/0x488
   kthread+0x118/0x120
   ret_from_fork+0x10/0x1c
  pci 0005:01:00.0: ready after 1023ms

Spec also mentions the following
     Unless Readiness Notifications mechanisms are used (see Section 6.23), the Root Complex
     and/or system software must allow at least 1.0 s after a Conventional Reset of a device, before it
     may determine that a device which fails to return a Successful Completion status for a valid
     Configuration Request is a broken device. This period is independent of how quickly Link
     training completes.

My understanding is that this 1sec waiting is supposed to be done by the PCIe sub-system and not the host
controller driver.
FWIW, this particular device is taking a little more time than 1 sec (i.e. 1023 ms)
I'm now wondering why is it that the CRS has a timeout of 60 secs than just 1 sec?
