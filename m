It's not only a registers dump, as you may see there is also a dump of
other properties like boosting value, OPPs selection and etc.

It looks to me that you're also missing important detail that debug
messages are compiled out unless DEBUG is defined for the drivers
build. So in order to get the debug message a user shall explicitly add
#define DEBUG macro to the code or enable debug messages globally in
the kernel's config. There is also an option for dynamic debug messages
in the kernel, but it doesn't matter now because all these messages are
turned into tracepoints later in the patch #17.

>=20

The intent was to have an option for dynamic debugging of the driver and
initially debug messages were good enough, but then it became not enough
and hence the debug messages were turned into tracepoints in the patch
#17. Would it be acceptable to squash this patch and #17?
