There might be a little more we can talk about in this regard.  I did
bring up the "Slot implemented" bit, but after thinking about it more,
I don't really think the host bridge driver should be looking at that.
That's a PCIe concept, and it's really *downstream* from the host
bridge itself.  The host bridge is logically a device on the CPU bus,
not the PCI bus.

I'm starting to think that the host bridge driver probe should be
disconnected from question of whether the root port links are up.

Logically, the host bridge driver connects the CPU bus to a PCI root
bus, so it converts CPU-side accesses to PCI config, memory, or I/O
port transactions.  Given that, the PCI core can enumerate devices on
the root bus and downstream buses.

Devices on the root bus typically include Root Ports, but might also
include endpoints, Root Complex Integrated Endpoints, Root Complex
Event Collectors, etc.  I think in principle, we would want the host
bridge probe to succeed so we can use these devices even if none of
the Root Ports have a link.

If a Root Port is present, I think users will expect to see it in the
"lspci" output, even if its downstream link is not up.  That will
enable things like manually poking the Root Port via "setpci" for
debug.  And if it has a connector, the generic pciehp should be able
to handle hot-add events without any special help from the host bridge
driver.

On ACPI systems there is no concept of the host bridge driver probe
failing because of lack of link on a Root Port.  If a Root Port
doesn't have an operational link, we still keep the pci_root.c driver,
and we'll enumerate the Root Port itself.  So I tend to think DT
systems should behave the same way, i.e., the driver probe should
succeed unless it fails to allocate resources or something similar.  I
think this is analogous to a NIC or USB adapter driver, where the
probe succeeds even if there's no network cable or USB device
attached.
