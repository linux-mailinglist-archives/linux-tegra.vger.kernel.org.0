I'm not sure I understand how checking clients would work. Is there a
mechanism for the emc driver to know if cpufreq is registered to icc
in a way that works with probe deferrals, but also allows for it to be
optional?

Alternatively if there is not, can we just accept the abi break and
have this and the dt change depend on each other? I know it's not
desirable or the first choice, but if the other option is to rewrite
part of the icc system, then perhaps it should be an option.

So you're saying that even with the dt changes, this change on
tegra194 still does not boot before the regression test framework
times out? If so, I need some more details about this. I have not seen
issues on p2972 or p3518. For example, if I boot to android recovery
where I set the cpufreq governor to performance, I see emc clock rate
set to 2133 MHz and 1600 MHz respectively. And boot time from kernel
start to pixels on display is 15 seconds, give or take a couple
seconds. This is using the boot stack from l4t r32.7.6.

I am unaware of a way to disable icc from userspace. That would be
useful to me as well. And for the record, I'm not refusing to make
such a change. I would just want to have a series to change all the
others uploaded and merged concurrently. But I cannot test t20 or t30.
Only t124+.
