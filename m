OF_RESERVED_MEM is not selectable, so it cannot be disabled for regular
builds.

When I proposed to add dependencies, I indeed did not check whether
these are selectable symbols. My advise was not accurate.

Usually we do not add dependencies to each driver on each kernel
non-selectable feature. It would be too much (depends on HAS_IOMEM,
REGMAP, OF, MFD_SYSCON, OF_RESERVED_MEM and probably many more)... There
are of course exceptions and mistakes (I think I should not add
OF_ADDRESS to OMAP_GPMC).

If such features are non-selectable, usually architecture enforces them
so the driver does not need to. For compile testing, these features
should come with stubs. If there are no stubs, the dependency for
compile testing could be added:
ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC || (COMPILE_TEST && OF_RESERVED_MEM)

We add the dependencies for selectable options which driver needs, e.g.
DEVFREQ, CPUFREQ, PM_xxx

Since you proposed already to add stubs for OF_RESERVED_MEM, adding
dependency on it does not bring any benefit.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
