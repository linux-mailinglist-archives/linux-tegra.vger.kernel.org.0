Alright, I see that the OF selection is all over the MFD Kconfig, hence
let's keep it consistent.

I also prefer the explicit variant more, but some other kernel
maintainers may disagree.

The regmap core code performs all the necessary checks before driver's
code is reached, perhaps I just overlooked something before. Hence it
will be removed in the next revision.

Maybe the read_poll_timeout() helper could be used for that, but I think
the open-coded variant is much easier to perceive, don't you agree?

These are the firmware-defined specific command opcodes, I'll add
defines for them to make it more clear, thanks.
