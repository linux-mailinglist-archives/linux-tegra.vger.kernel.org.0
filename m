I admit I also do not see the real issue here. The DRAM_DEV_SEL_0 fits
in u32 and there is no other bitwise arithmetic than just OR, so why
clang assumes it can have 32 most signifcant bits toggled on?

+Cc Nathan and Nick,
Maybe you could shed some light here on this warning?

Dmitry,
In general you should not ignore it because:
1. This breaks allyesconfig with clang on powerpc (or it is one of the
stoppers),
2. We might want in some future to build it with clang.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
