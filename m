I'm surprised using DT_SCHEMA_FILES makes a difference. I'm guessing
that has your 'unevaluatedProperties' support. If so, that means
there's an unintended side effect that any common schema property
becomes always allowed. That's good for 'status' and 'phandle', but
not so much for 'reg', '*-gpios, '*-names', etc.

The purpose of DT_SCHEMA_FILES is to see warnings just from that
schema file. If the core schema was warning free, we could add that,
but it's not. Plus that wouldn't solve the problem here. 'status' and
'phandle' are added to each schema by the tooling (along with other
things), not by another schema file (well, they are in another schema
file, but they are added to each schema so that 'additionalProperties:
false' works).

This is certainly a limitation in the tooling in that what you have is
a bit different from the expected form. Generally it is expected that
everything is defined under the top-level 'properties' and then any
'if/then' schema only add further constraints. However, you have the
child nodes only defined under an if/then. We could fix that, but I'm
not sure I want to. IMO, extensive use of if/then is a sign the schema
should be split up. More on that below.

I'm not saying don't describe the hierarchy.

The first option is 1 host1x schema file per SoC (roughly) and the
'host1x' parent node would be duplicated in each one. That doesn't
worry me too much as it's all standard properties and not that many of
them. Though you could have a common 'host1x-bus.yaml' just describing
the parent node properties that each <soc>-host1x.yaml references.

The 2nd option is keep this as a single file, but just move every
child node definition under the top-level 'patternProperties'. This
option has the limitation that you can't enforce which child nodes are
valid per SoC.

Hopefully, it's clear why that doesn't help here. But don't worry,
there's plenty of other work to do on the tooling. :)
