DRM is only one of many subsystems that will have to deal with 
syncpoints, so I have wanted to have a central solution instead of 
reimplementing the same stuff everywhere. sync_files seem like the 
"missing feature", but they are difficult to use it with the fileno 
limits. But as has been said many times, they are intended only to 
transfer fences between the implementations in individual drivers, so I 
guess I will have to abandon this dream.

I mean the poll/select etc. series of functions, which wait for file 
descriptors to become ready. If there's some trick that allows syncobjs 
to be used for that, then please tell.
