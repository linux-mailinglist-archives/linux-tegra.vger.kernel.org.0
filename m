My past experience tells that your assumption is incorrect. There are
quite a lot of people who will update kernel, but not DTB.

ARM devices have endless variations of bootloaders and individual quirks
required for a successful installation of a kernel. Kernel update by
distro usually isn't a thing on ARM.
