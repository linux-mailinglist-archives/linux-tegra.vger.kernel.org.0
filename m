I can confirm that I have the same issue on a DisplayPort output of =
t194.
IMO, this patch will need to be reworked a bit to enable the CMU for =
this
output as well. I hacked this change in for DisplayPort, and then it
functioned as intended there as well.

I've traced back to the reason this is necessary. The DC hub driver is
applying an sRGB degamma for every RGB plane (presumably for blending),
and then nothing reapplies the EOTF later on. Without gamma correction
in places where it is expected, images are going to look "too dark".

Which does raise the point that there is an alternative implementation
where we do not degamma RGB planes in the first place. But this may have
unintended consequences when it comes to composition.

The SOR does not appear to handle YCbCr outputs at this time, so =
enabling
the CMU assuming an sRGB EOTF seems like a reasonable path here, to me.
