There's clk_set_rate_exclusive() for this purpose.

Well, thanks for HW designers, this exists and some SoCs has less PLLs than
needed, and they can't be dedicated for some hw blocks.

Honestly I tried my best to find a smart way to set the DSI clock tree
with only 2 endpoints of the tree, but CCF will explore all possibilities
and since you cannot set constraints, locking a sub-tree is the smartest
way I found.
In this case, the PLL is common between the DSI controller and video generator,
so to keep the expected clock ratio, the smart way is to set the freq on
one side, lock the subtree and set the rate on the other side.
An API permitting to set multiple rates to multiple clocks in a single call
would be the solution, but not sure if we could possibly write such algorithm.
