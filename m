Are you suggesting to have some alternate way of users configuring 
sample rates (and other params) and not use mixer control method?

This is a typical use case we see,
- [stream-1] Lets say high resolution audio is playing (96kHz, 24-bit, 
stereo)
- [stream-2] Randomly system notifications of small durations come 
(48kHz, 16-bit, stereo)
The requirement is, both streams should be mixed and played.

Tegra Audio HW has Mixer module for mixing multiple streams. In above 
case, stream-2 requires upsampling to 96kHz (employ SRC) and 24-bit. 
Then mix with stream1 and play. This needs to be configured at runtime. 
In another session, mixing for 192kHz and 48kHz might be required with 
the same audio path. Idea was to allow users to setup their custom path 
for specific audio applications. In the current series, I am focussing 
on I/O modules (where overrides do not demonstrate the above use case) 
and does not include other HW accelerators that Tegra Audio HW offers. 
Things would be more complicated when user wants to use multiplexers and 
demultiplexers. For simple use cases overrides are not used.

Is there a better way for user to configure custom audio paths?
