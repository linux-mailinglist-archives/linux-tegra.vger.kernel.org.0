For anyone interested, I succeeded at chainloading u-boot on the Ouya.
The Linux Kernel with low level debugging enabled in the decompressor
will print the load address.

Jumping to kernel at:4861 ms

C:0x80A000C0-0x8112BA40->0x8152C700-0x81C58080
Uncompressing Linux...

So by setting the u-boot text base to 0x80A00000 u-boot now executes,
but it would then immediately silently reboot.
Turns out I needed to define the console in the device-tree, which
isn't defined in the u-boot tegra30-cardhu.dts.
It would then freeze at relocation time, as it was trying to overwrite
the trustzone ram space.
#define CONFIG_PRAM 2048 solves that issue.

I'd like to know if u-boot can read the reserved-memory device-tree
node and use it instead of CONFIG_PRAM?

Otherwise the only issue it seems to have it is does not read the
nvidia proprietary partition table.
Is there a way to force u-boot to read the backup gpt table similar to
the android kernel's method?
