Because until these IPI patches, the range 0-7 never ever appeared
as actual hwirqs in the GIC domain. SGIs were handled in the GIC
code, behind the core kernel's back. As soon as we start using
an actual domain mapping for hwirq 0, the PMC driver starts messing
with it.

It's easy to take it as part of the same pull request as the IPI
stuff. Not fully bisectable for this platform, but close enough.
I may even be able to merge this in *before* the IPI patches
(I'd need to rebuild irq/irqchip-next, but that won't alter the commit
ids of the individual patches as they are on separate branches).

Sure. Let me know what you find.

Thanks,
