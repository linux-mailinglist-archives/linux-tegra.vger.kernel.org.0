We've discussed this in the past and I still think your rule about DT
bindings needing to go in through the driver tree is impractical. Yes,
it means you get around the checkpatch warning about undocumented
compatible strings, but at the expense of a new warning in the Tegra
tree because the bindings aren't there.

I did not get a response to my suggestion about creating a shared
branch, which was included in v1 already. So I went ahead and did what
I thought was best. PCI maintainers are free to not pull this if they
don't want to. I also offered to address any further review comments if
there were any.

It's got a Reviewed-by from Rob and there were no corresponding driver
changes associated with it. There's literally no reason for this to go
in through a subsystem tree.

Ugh... really? I was Cc'ed to you as a DT maintainer as well as the
devicetree mailing list, so I'm sure you've seen it. This had also been
reviewed by Rob a long time ago, and honestly, it's also quite trivial.
It's been on the list for a month and there were no objections, so it
does pass all of the criteria you mentioned before.

Stop making these baseless accusations, Krzysztof. You were on Cc and
DT maintainers have seen and reviewed these patches. You're grasping at
straws to somehow try to make my life miserable and I don't know why.
