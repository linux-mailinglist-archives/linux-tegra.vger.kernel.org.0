Agree.
This was there in the very first commit of this driver i.e.
77ffc1465cec32489889d6bc9c288b7b0d2ce9fb which added this driver for Tegra20
as arch/arm/mach-tegra/pcie.c Since there was no device-tree concept back then,
could it be the case that this quirk comes into picture *only* if kernel is built
for Tegra20 and not otherwise? Even then, I agree that using PCI_ANY_ID is quite
wild way of applying a quirk.
