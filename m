I guess the only thing here that we need to get right from the start is
the new module name, everything else is relatively easy to change
later. drm_dp_helper.ko seems fine by me.

Note that this will also affect the drm_kms_helper.ko module parameters
dp_aux_i2c_speed_khz, dp_aux_i2c_transfer_size and
drm_dp_cec_unregister_delay, which will move to drm_dp_helper.ko.

See the monstrosity near the top of drm_kms_helper_common.c I had to add
for backward compatibility when I moved drm_edid_load.c from
drm_kms_helper.ko to drm.ko. That was perhaps different, as these seem
more like debug knobs, but at a minimum this needs to be mentioned in
the commit message, and certainly needs acks from Dave and/or Daniel.


BR,
Jani.
