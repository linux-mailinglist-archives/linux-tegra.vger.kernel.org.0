Ah, I re-figured out that again. The memory controller drivers are
defining a single "IOMMU group" for both of the display controllers.

Yes, it should be okay to put all DRM devices into the same group, like
it is done now for the displays. It also should resolve problem with the
domains shortage on T30 since now there are maximum 3 domains in use:
host1x, drm and vde.

I actually just checked that the original problem still exists
and this change solves it as well:

Please let me know whether you're going to make a patch or if I should
do it.
