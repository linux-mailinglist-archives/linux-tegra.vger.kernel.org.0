I don't think that we can pass the complex topology in the simple string (127
chars). For the time, it's better to pass only the vital information which the
user space requires for the fine-grained hw configuration detection and
description.

For the above example, the "codec:" prefix may be replaced by the purpose
string (like "hs:" - headset, "spk:" - speaker) etc. This information is not
available in the ASoC components (purpose / location / exact I/O config etc.).

It would be nice to have this layer with the topology description, but until
someone designs it, it's much easier to describe the configuration and hints
in the simple string passed to the user space.

Actually, for ACPI/PCI platforms, the information is gathered from the tables
or detected by PCI IDs. For the device tree. It may be worth to allow to pass
this string from the device tree, too. I believe that the DT config author has
enough information to describe the hardware.
