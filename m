This series adds audio graph based sound card support for Tegra210
platforms like Jetson-TX1 an Jetson-Nano. The following preparatory
audio graph enhancement series is already merged.
 * https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/alsa-devel/list/?series=375629&state=*

Following are the summary of changes:
 * Add graph/audio-graph based schemas or schema updates for Tegra210
   component and machine drivers.
 * Add Tegra audio graph machine driver.
 * Add required DT support for Jetson-TX1/Nano.

This work is based on earlier discussion of DPCM usage for Tegra
and simple card driver updates.
 * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/30/519
 * https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/27/4

This series depends on following patch from Rob Herring:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/devicetree-bindings/patch/20201117013349.2458416-3-robh@kernel.org/

Changelog
=========

v5 -> v6
--------
 * Added ports or port description in YAML docs for Tegra AHUB
   devices and graph card in patch 1/6 and 2/6. Reference of
   audio-graph-port.yaml is used for AHUB devices.
 * Dropped redundant NULL check return for of_device_get_match_data()
   in patch 3/6.
 * Added 'Reviewed-by' tag from Jon Hunter.
 * No changes in remaining patches.

v4 -> v5
--------
 * Audio graph related changes were sent in separate v5 series as
   mentioned above and are dropped from current series.
 * Graph and audio graph doc patches are dropped from this series
   and are sent separately as mentioned above.
 * Minor change with phandle label for TX1 and Nano platform DT files.
 * No changes in other patches.

v3 -> v4
--------
 * Added new patches to convert graph.txt and audio-graph-card.txt
   to corresponding json-schema files. Later these references
   are used in Tegra audio graph schema.

 * AHUB component binding docs are updated to reflect the usage
   of ports/port/endpoint

 * More common stuff is moved into graph_parse_of() and this is
   used by both generic and Tegra audio graph.

 * DT binding for Tegra audio graph is updated to included "ports { }"

 * As per the suggestion 'void *data' member is dropped from
   'asoc_simple_priv' and instead container method is used to
   maintain required custom data internal to Tegra audio graph. 

v2 -> v3
--------
 * Dropped new compatible addition in generic graph driver
   after reviewing it with Morimoto-san. Instead added Tegra
   audio graph driver and new compatibles are added in the same.
 * Added new patches to expose new members for customization
   in audio graph driver.
 * Added new patch for Tegra audio graph driver and related
   documentation.
 * Minor change in below commit where mutex version of helper is used
   "ASoC: audio-graph: Identify 'no_pcm' DAI links for DPCM"
 * DT binding is updated to use the newly exposed compatibles
 * No changes in other patches

v1 -> v2
--------
 * Re-organized ports/endpoints description for ADMAIF and XBAR.
   Updated DT patches accordingly.
 * After above change, multiple Codec endpoint support is not
   required and hence dropped for now. This will be considered
   separately if at all required in future.
 * Re-ordered patches in the series.
