Indeed they shouldn't, but if something *does* happen to go wrong then I 
think it's worth having proper handling in place, since the consequences 
otherwise include a screaming "spurious" fault or just silently losing 
some transactions and possibly locking up part of the system altogether 
(depending on HUPCF at least - I recall MMU-500 also behaving funnily 
WRT TLB maintenance while an IRQ is outstanding, but that was long 
enough ago that it might have been related to the old CFCFG behaviour).

Until we sort out the reserved memory regions thing (the new IORT spec 
is due Real Soon Now(TM)...) some systems are going to keep suffering 
transient context faults during boot - those may make the display 
unhappy until it gets reset, but we certainly don't want to invite the 
possibility of them wedging the SMMU itself.

Robin.
