On linux-next without this patch series, I just disabled mclk to be=20
enabled all the time (removed set_rate from utils_init) and also=20
disabled default enable from clock driver.

So somehow disabling mclk is preventing suspend entry.

Probably debugging suspend issue on Tegra30 when audio mclk is disabled=20
can be done separately and will keep audio mclk enabled in=20
asoc_utils_init with comment mentioning this issue and fix as TBD to=20
move on with PMC clock fixes.
