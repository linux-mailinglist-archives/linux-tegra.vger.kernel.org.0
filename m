Instead, can you prepare a patch on top of Sergey's adding a 'oneOf'
entry with 'ecam'. As this is a new thing, it should have its own
entry. Then when merging, we just throw out the change from your side.

I'd really prefer that bindings don't go thru the soc tree unless
there's some strong reason. The default is to go via the subsystem
trees. Beyond 'we are running the dtschema checks on all our dts files
and can't have the warnings', I don't know what that would be. I wish
everyone was doing that, but I'm pretty sure most are not.
