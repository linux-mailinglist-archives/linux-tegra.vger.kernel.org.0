It should "work" since you removed the ddc-i2c-bus phandle from the
panel nodes, and thus, panel->ddc won't be used during panel-edp driver
probe. But this looks like a hack rather than a fix.

I'm not sure why and how devm_of_dp_aux_populate_ep_devices() usage
should be relevant here. The drm_dp_aux_register() still should to
invoked before devm_of_dp_aux_populate_ep_devices(), otherwise
panel->ddc adapter won't be registered.

The panel->ddc isn't used by the new panel-edp driver unless panel is
compatible with "edp-panel". Hence the generic_edp_panel_probe() should
either fail or crash for a such "edp-panel" since panel->ddc isn't fully
instantiated, AFAICS.
