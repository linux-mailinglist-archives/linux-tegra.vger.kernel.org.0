As I wrote above, there are fewer divisions in the code as a result of this patch.

Then I also found that powertop expects KHz. This is actually something that devfreq core
potentially could improve by allowing drivers to specify what units are used for the freqs
such that sysfs interface could present freqs to userpspace in a predictable manner.

Lastly, this patch comes very handy for the patch11, because of the replacement of
avg_count with avg_freq which helps to keep code cleaner in further patches. Please note
that this patch doesn't change logic of the code.

This driver used Hz units for the OPPs from the very beginning and then there were
Hz<->KHz conversion bugs that were fixed by previous patches. This patch doesn't fix any
KHz-conversion issue and merely makes a minor clean up by using KHz units everywhere in
the code, starting from OPPs that are created by dev_pm_opp_add().

Alright, I understand that it makes easier for you to review patches without going back
and forth between patches, verifying every changed line of the previous patches of this
series.

The OPPs were always defined in Hz units in this driver. The patch5 was created much
earlier than this patch and thus I'm making changes here to the code that was added in patch5.

Okay, I'll try to change the order of the patches. But usually it takes a lot if time and
effort to rebase patches and then re-test them, so I'm trying to avoid that when not
absolutely necessary.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you're meaning by the "prototype" here. In case of this
particular hunk, the freq==dev->avg_freq and dev->avg_count is replaced with dev->avg_freq
in this patch as well. Hence this is a cosmetic change that doesn't change any logic of
the code. I'll see if this all could be made a bit more clear and easier for review.
