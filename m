Yes that was my initial understanding, but your previous response was
confusing. I should have read this first.

Indeed, we don't have any support to pass run-time residency hints in PSCI
today.

Before we jump to implementation in TF-A we need to get agreement to get this
added to the specification to support in OSPM/Linux. TF-A is just one
implementation of PSCI and may not be only one.

Formally you can raise any specification related queries to
https://developer.arm.com/support or support@arm.com. I will ask the author
of PSCI specification internally to take a look at this thread and chime in
if they can.

Yes, I just asked the same question as response to your earlier email. Thanks
for confirming that it can be moved out of OSPM/Linux and DT

We still need to get agreement on the specification front 😉.
