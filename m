I tried (in several attempts) and couldn't find a way how to
meaningfully squash the old drivers. It's a lot of unnecessary churning
that won't help with reviewing of the code at all because new driver is
structured differently and beating of old drivers until they resemble
the new one just not worth it. I'll write a bit more detailed commit
message, emphasizing the details, hope it will be helpful. The old
drivers are ~200 LOC each and the new one will be ~300 LOC + 50 lines of
comments, I don't think that it's really very hard to review as it it
may initially looked like to you, Jon.
