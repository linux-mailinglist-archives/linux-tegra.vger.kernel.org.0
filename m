In the trivial cookie for unmanaged domains, yes, but in that case the 
responsibility is on VFIO to provide a suitable (i.e. sub-32-bit) 
address range for that cookie in the first place. In the managed case, 
allocation uses the streaming mask via iommu_dma_get_msi_page() calling 
__iommu_dma_map(). Admittedly the mask can then get overlooked when 
reusing an existing mapping, which strictly could pose a problem if you 
have multiple devices with incompatible masks in the same group (and 
such that the PCI stuff doesn't already mitigate it), but that's such an 
obscure corner case that I'm reticent to introduce the complication to 
handle it until it's actually proven necessary.

Robin.
