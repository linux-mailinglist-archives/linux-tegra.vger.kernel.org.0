Please note that anything before V1.2A is considered obsolete sample
hardware [1] which may or may not perform as per your requirements.

Please note that 4.15 is long since obsolete [2] and not any of the
still supported long term variants.

Please note that any such downstream patch set is quite exclusively for
that particular kernel version and most possibly may not apply to
anything else. In your particular case, it also most likely also does
not even make any sense at all as 4.14 is a still maintained long term
kernel while 4.15 is simply obsolete.

As mentioned above I don't think this makes any sense at all.

This is the very first time I ever heard of any such issue. Any and all
mainline version always worked just fine and still do as of the latest
next-20190508.

This is quite clearly a non-issue as it works just fine in mainline.

BTW: For further downstream discussions you may want to revert to our
community forum [3] rather than bothering busy mainline maintainers.
