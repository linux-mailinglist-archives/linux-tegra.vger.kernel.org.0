We enable CC7 on Jetson TX1 and I've just verified on Jetson Nano that
there are no issues if CC7 is enabled. From the boot log I can see that
the architected timer is still used as scheduler clock.

So that either means that the scheduler doesn't mind if the clock is
disabled when a CPU is asleep or it means that CC7 does not impact the
architected timer. I thought we had already confirmed that the latter
isn't true, i.e. that the architected timer is disabled during CC7, so
that would mean that indeed the scheduler continues to work fine if the
clock is off during sleep. I also don't understand why it would break,
given that it's only put to sleep when there are no longer any tasks
running on it.
