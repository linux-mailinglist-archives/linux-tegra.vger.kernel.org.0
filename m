Adding a new callback seems reasonable to support this.

However, this is more questionable to me.

First, I don't think we should care about whether this is "power_on"
or not. At this point, performance states are treated orthogonal to
idle states in genpd. We may decide to change that in some way, but
that deserves a different change.

Second, I don't think we should call
dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state() from here. It's probably better
handled from the genpd callback itself, if/when needed.

That said, perhaps the new callback should just return a regular error
code and zero on success, rather than the current performance state.
See more below.

No, this isn't the right thing to do.

It looks like you are trying to use the ->rpm_pstate for
synchronization with runtime PM for consumer drivers. This is fragile
as it depends on the runtime PM deployment in the consumer driver. I
think you should look at ->rpm_pstate as a variable solely for
managing save/restore of the performance state for the device, during
runtime suspend/resume in genpd.

Synchronization of a vote for a performance state for a device, needs
to be managed by calling dev_pm_genpd_set_performance_state() - or by
calling an OPP function that calls it, like dev_pm_opp_set_rate(), for
example.

I don't see how this avoids tegra_pmc_genpd_default_perf_state() from
having to walk &genpd->child_links.

That's still an issue, right?

I am not saying you should change the clock rate. The current code
path that runs via devm_tegra_core_dev_init_opp_table() just calls
clk_get_rate and then dev_pm_opp_set_rate() with the current rate to
vote for the corresponding OPP level. Right?

Isn't this exactly what you want? No?

Kind regards
