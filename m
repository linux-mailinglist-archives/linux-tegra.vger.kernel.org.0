Hi Greg,

thanks, it was just to understand if the "Fixes:" tag would
automatically make it a stable kernel candidate when it hits Linus'
tree; I will drop it from the patch and we will post the patches to
stable@vger when/if we want it considered for stable, we just do not
want it to be automatically picked up, that's it.

Thanks for chiming in,
Lorenzo
