This IOCTL is required for GR2D/GR3D too, as they need to access memory 
as well. This is a different step from import/export -- first you import 
or allocate your memory so you have a GEM handle, then you map it to the 
channel, which does the IOMMU mapping (if there is an IOMMU).

Yeah, having separate nodes per engine might be better, e.g. so it's 
easier to do access control. I don't have a strong opinion on that though.
