Yeah, I was thinking about that as well and I agree with your assessment
that this should no longer be necessary after this patch. Any device
that would've gotten reordered by a deferred probe should now get
reordered after successful probe as well. The ordering of the DPM list
may not end up being exactly the same, but at least it should be from a
functional point of view.

I didn't want to roll these changes all into one so that we could first
make sure that this change itself works and then at a later time we
could remove the deferred probe reordering incrementally to validate
that we really no longer need it.

But thinking about it, it might be worth making these changes all at
once, so that when we break things we break them once instead of
potentially twice.

I think we still at least need to reorder the children recursively, but
I'm pretty sure we could also drop the reordering of consumer device
links because, yes, every consumer should defer probe if the provider
hasn't been probed yet, which in turn would cause the consumer to get
sorted into the right position in the DPM queue after its successful
probe.
