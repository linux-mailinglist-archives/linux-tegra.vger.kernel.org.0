Alright, so you fixed it by removing the ddc-i2c-bus phandles and I2C
DDC will work properly anyways with that on v5.16.

But the aux-bus usage still is irrelevant for the fix. Let's not use it
then.

There is no panel-edp driver in the v5.15. The EOL of v5.15 is Oct,
2023, hence we need to either use:

Approach #1:

1. apply my variant of the fix
2. backport it to v5.15
3. apply your variant without aux-bus, replacing my fix on 5.16+

Or

Approach #2:

1. remove ddc-i2c-bus phandles in DTs
2. backport (?) it to v5.15
3. apply your variant without aux-bus

Or

Approach #3:

1. ignore v5.15 and keep it screwed
2. apply your variant as is

Which approach will you prefer?

I'm not happy that older DTBs will be broken. Can we do better about it?

Is it possible to patch DT in the code by removing the ddc-i2c-bus phandle?

Or can we patch panel-simple on 5.15 and panel-edp on 5.16, making these
drivers to skip ddc-i2c-bus on Tegra+eDP? The eDP driver fixup will be
trivial, fixing older panel-simple will be more invasive.

I think the best solution will be to use Approach #1 and in the end
complete it with this panel-edp workaround below. This approach will
have minimal code impact on 5.16+ kernels and will keep older DTBs
working. Are you okay with this?
