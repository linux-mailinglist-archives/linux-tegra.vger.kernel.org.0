Don't you care about normal people at all? Do you assume that everyone
must to be a kernel developer to be able to use Tegra devices? :/

It's not a problem for you to figure out why display is broken, for
other people it's a problem. Usually nobody will update DTB without a
well known reason, instead device will be dusted on a shelf. In the end
you won't have any users at all.
