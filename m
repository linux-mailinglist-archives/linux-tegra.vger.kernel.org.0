Tegra186 and newer -- all chips with the ARM SMMU. To add a little bit, 
each engine can address two stream IDs, one for firmware and one for 
data. All user specified buffers are mapped into the data IOMMU domain, 
and these are switched between jobs / applications.

As an aside, currently each engine has its own firmware stream ID, but 
that's a bit wasteful, since the kernel allocates a separate IOMMU 
domain for each. The firmwares are all read-only so they could be in a 
shared one. We've had to consolidate these on some platforms that ran 
out of IOMMU domains otherwise. Not really a concern with upstream 
platforms, though.

Also need to program the THI_STREAMID / TRANSCFG registers during boot.
