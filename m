I see that if quirk macros and API are present in pcie-tegra194.c file and =
driver is built
as a module, quirk API is not getting invoked by the system, whereas it get=
s invoked if driver
is built into kernel. Is this behavior expected? I think it is because of q=
uirk API symbol
not available as part of global quirk symbol table when driver is built as =
a module?
for now, I'm going to keep quirk macros and API in pci/quirks.c file itself=
.
