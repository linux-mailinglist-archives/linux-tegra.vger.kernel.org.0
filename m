I see the delay in __pci_start_power_transition(), but I don't see how
it's relevant.  It's only called by pci_set_power_state(), and while
many drivers call pci_set_power_state() from legacy .resume() methods,
the pci_pm_resume_noirq() path where Vidya is seeing problems doesn't
use it.

That sounds like a reasonable argument for why firmware should be
responsible for this delay, but I don't think that's very clear in the
ACPI spec, so I wouldn't be surprised if it got missed.

Based on Vidya's backtrace, I think the resume path with problems is
this:

  pci_pm_resume_noirq
    pci_pm_default_resume_early
      pci_power_up
        if (platform_pci_power_manageable(dev))
          platform_pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0)  # <-- FW delay here?
        pci_raw_set_power_state
        pci_update_current_state
          pci_device_is_present        # <-- config read returns CRS

So I think your suggestion is that Vidya's firmware should be doing
the delay inside platform_pci_set_power_state()?

Vidya, you typically work on Tegra, so I assume this is on an arm64
system?  Does it have ACPI?  Do you have access to the firmware
developers to ask about who they expect to do the delays?

I agree, a general delay doesn't sound good.  Are you thinking
something like this?

  void pci_power_up(struct pci_dev *dev)
  {
    if (platform_pci_power_manageable(dev)) {
      platform_pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0);
      if (dev->XXX)
        msleep(dev->XXX);
    }
    ...

We already have dev->d3_delay and d3cold_delay, so it's getting a bit
messy to keep them all straight.
