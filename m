Indeed you are right. The problem is 'additionalProperties: true' in
spi-controller.yaml makes everything evaluated. I thought
'additionalProperties: true' was equivalent to the default, but that's
not how it's working. Now to figure out if this is correct operation
or not. No wonder there were relatively few fixes when
'unevaluatedProperties' got implemented...
