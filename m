The cpuidle driver uses LP2 terminology for everything that comes from
the external arch / firmware includes. But it says CC6 for everything
that is internal to the driver. So yes, there is a bit of new/old
terminology mixing in the code.

The arch code / PMC driver / TF firmware are all saying LP2. The LP2
naming is also a part of the device-tree binding.

It will be a lot of mess to rename the mach-tegra/pm.c code. I guess
eventually it could be moved to drivers/soc/, so maybe it will be better
to postpone the renaming until then?
