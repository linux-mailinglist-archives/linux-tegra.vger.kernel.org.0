Rotation is a common DT panel property that is described in the
panel-common.yaml. This property is supported by all panel bindings
because these bindings inherent the common properties from the
panel-common.yaml.

I don't think that it makes sense to wire up rotation property to all
panel drivers at once because those drivers will be untested, at least I
don't know anything about those other panels and can't test them. It
will be much better to support the rotation on by as-needed basis for
each panel driver individually.
