The property was introduced almost exclusively for tiny drm panels.
Those ones are a bit different from the rest (in panel/) -
MIPI-DBI/SPI w/o (not connected at least) an actual GPU.

To make it a bit better, the rotation is seemingly performed in the
tiny driver itself ouch.

Seems like that was an unintentional change with the conversion to YAML.
Beforehand only a few selected panels had rotation. Upon closer look -
some panels do have follow-up fixes, to remove/limit the implicit
inclusion.

Sam seems like you've done most of the YAML conversion. IMHO it would
make sense to revisit the patches and inherit common properties only
as applicable.

How about CCing the author and reviewer asking them to test the patch?
The only place where the patches might cause an issue is with tiny,
although patches would still be appreciated.
