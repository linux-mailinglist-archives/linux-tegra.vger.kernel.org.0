Another provider did come up, and were requested (by me) to work with
Dipen on the subsystem in august last year, that was the Intel PMC in the
Elkhart and Tiger Lake platforms and forward:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-gpio/cover/20210824164801.28896-1-lakshmi.sowjanya.d@intel.com/#2766453

[I added the other Intel people on that submission to CC]

Intel wanted to put this into the GPIO subsystem and what I saw as maintainer
was that this is a general problem and general purpose (binary) I/O just isn't
going to be the only thing they timestamp. Other events will be for IIO and
hwmon or whatever. They have been
requested to contribute to Dipens work the recent 9 months ... so... well I
understand people can get other priorities and stuff.

Dipen did the right thing and created a separate subsystem that is a provider
to GPIO and can be a provider to things like IIO as well, which is what
it needs to be because for things like sensor fusion and industrial control
systems in general precise timestamps are
of uttermost importance. And IIO handle a lot of sensors.

Intel is talking about "input timestamping", admittedly it is done in hardware
but the point is to timestamp input I/O events.

HTE is "hardware timestamping engine", we have hwmon, hwspinlock,
hwtracing so maybe hwstamping would be a more natural name then?
