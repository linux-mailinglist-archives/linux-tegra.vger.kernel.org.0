I agree.

We do have the iommu properties from our display node and we typically
do have a reserved-memory region for the existing framebuffer that we
want to associate with those properties.

The one exception is on devices targeted to run Windows, where the
memory region is passed to the kernel using UEFI GOP.

But as you say, the information is available to the kernel already.

I think that's fine, I saw that there's a bit to configure if multiple
SMR matches is considered a fault or not, so I will verify if this is
what causes the faults I saw on one of my platforms and if I can change
it.

I still would need that we ensure that we don't have lapses in time
where we're lacking mappings among the SMRs.

I have reserved-memory regions for a number of co-processors, to
facilitate static access configuration, as such I ended up with having
100+MB of various DSP memory mapped into the temporary context.

Right, I think that before any of these are actually used we will have a
device attached and the region properly mapped (as is done today
already).

You can find this in:

0e764a01015d ("iommu/arm-smmu: Allow client devices to select direct mapping")

Which conceptually follows what is done on x86 machines.
