Yes. There is a plan to boot kernel through UEFI (using ACPI) on this system.
So, I'll move it to drivers/pci/quirks.c file.

Ok. I'll take care of it in the next patch series.

Ok. I'll take it up with our hardware engineers to have only MSI/MSI-X interrupts
getting generated for all root port received events.
