Ok. I'll take care of it in next patch series.

I'm planning to remove this given we have sysfs way (Heiner's patch series @
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=107392 to control which ASPM states
can be enabled run time. In case if that is not going to work for a given use case, I'll push
patches separately for controlling ASPM states advertisement/working.
