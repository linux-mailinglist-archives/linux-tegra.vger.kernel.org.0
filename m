Host controller drivers shouldn't change this unless there's some host
controller defect that means the generic code can't do the right
thing.  Even then, I'd prefer that the host controller driver merely
set a quirk bit that describes the defect, e.g., "mps_*_broken".  Then
the generic code could pay attention to that and we wouldn't have to
make "pcie_bus_config" a part of the ABI.

From your description, it sounds like there's nothing actually wrong
with the Tegra194 hardware, but the generic code isn't as smart about
setting MPS as it possibly could be.  My solution to that would be to
make the generic code smarter so everybody can benefit.
