No. The required parameters for cache maintenance by set/way are 
discoverable from the CTR, and if you're particularly lucky they might 
even happen to reflect the underlying physical cache structures, but 
there's absolutely no guarantee of that, and there definitely exist 
cases where they don't.

Oh, I'd missed this - per the current state of things, we should really 
have a proper compatible for the PMU as well.

(Suggestions for ways to improve the current state of things for better 
forward- and backward- compatibility welcome - I started having a mad 
idea about autogenerating a PMU name from the CPU compatible if the 
generic PMU compatible is present, but I'm not sure that's realistic).
