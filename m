So we can't accept that older dt's will run slower on a newer kernel
and say that a newer dt is needed for full performance?

If that's not an option, then I have no idea how to resolve this. I'm
not greatly knowledgeable about the icc subsystem. I can try to look
into options, but I'm not greatly optimistic about me finding one. If
someone could suggest a concept on how to make it work, I could
implement it. But I'm not even seeing the concept right now.

So, I checked out next-20251210, then b4 shazam'ed this series and the
matching dt series,
20251021-tegra186-icc-p3-v3-0-68184ee8a89c@gmail.com. Then built with
LLVM=3D1 ARCH=3Darm64 make defconfig
LLVM=3D1 ARCH=3Darm64 make -j33 Image nvidia/tegra194-p2972-0000.dtb

I packaged them into an android boot image using a lightly modified
copy of Gnurou's bbinitramfs which just drops to a busybox shell. Note
that this includes no modules, and since the pcie driver is =3Dm in
defconfig, it is not included. Then I flashed that with the l4t
r32.7.6 boot stack to p2972. I got the shell on uart after 4.275
seconds in the kernel. Per sysfs, the cpufreq governor is schedutil
and all policies are idling at min freq, 115200. And per debugfs, the
emc clock is 800000000. All this looks to be as expected.

I have no idea why the regression test setup is timing out. I have not
seen the issue through any of my testing. On pure mainline as per the
above paragraph, or with the patches on the android common kernel, as
per my target use case. I don't know what to do if I can't replicate
the issue. I don't suppose the flash package for the regression test
setup is something that could be released?
