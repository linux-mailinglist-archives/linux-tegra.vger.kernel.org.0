He suggested that the immutable branch is a better option, I decided to implement this suggestion. So far I only sent out the memory patches which make use of the new helper, there will be more patches. The memory patches are intended to show that this helper can be utilized right now. My plan was to finalize this patch first, then Thierry will apply it and I will be able to sent the rest of the patches telling that they depend on the immutable branch.

Diving the series is fine, but an API and its users should always be
in the same series. You can still apply them differently anyway.

It can never be obvious to anyone without looking at the API in
detail. So if it is indeed required, please keep the comment as is.
