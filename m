That will not work so well as a schema because all the common PCI bus 
related properties don't apply. Child nodes if any for an EP aren't PCI 
devices either. Though you could have 3 files with common properties, 
host binding and ep bindings. 

While we don't have anything in terms of common PCI EP bindings, I 
somewhat expect that to change. There's been something for how to define 
multiple EP functions for example.

Whether the driver shares a lot of code or not, it's fundamentally a 
different device and driver stack.

'reset-gpios' is used for PERST. Though in this case it's an input 
rather than output.
