Sigh... at that point I'm inclined to suggest we give up and stop trying 
to drive these things with arm-smmu. The XZR thing was bad enough, but 
if they're not even going to pretend to implement the architecture 
correctly then I'm not massively keen to continue tying the 
architectural driver in further knots if innocent things like 
CONFIG_IOMMU_DEFAULT_PASSTHROUGH are going to unexpectedly and 
catastrophically fail. We have qcom-iommu for hypervisor-mediated SMMUs, 
and this new hypervisor behaviour sounds to me more like "qcom-iommu++" 
with reassignable stream-to-context mappings, rather than a proper Arm 
SMMU emulation.

...which arm-smmu specifically does not do because it's a silly waste of 
resources - typically context banks are even scarcer than S2CRs.

Robin.
