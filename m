Exciting! I think I do have one of those devices, though equipped with a
Tegra132, so the 64-bit equivalent of Tegra124.

Okay, that's pretty good given that we haven't had testers for a few
years now.

I'm not sure what the right way is to fix this. The values in DT are
clearly required to be nanoseconds, so either the driver needs to learn
about those or the core would need to convert somehow. The core doesn't
know about what the driver supports, so it can't do a really good job.
Maybe a good compromise would be to have the core expose a helper that
can convert to clock cycles (the reverse is already done in
spi_delay_to_ns()), which drivers can then use if they only support
clock cycles.

I think that'd still be preferable over relying on the core's manual
delaying. If we can make it work, obviously.

I think LPAE cannot be enabled by default because it would break on
Tegra20 and Tegra30 which both don't support LPAE. Tegra114 was the
first to feature this (I think), so we'd need an extra LPAE config
that's applicable only for newer chips.

Not sure how much can be done about this. Unless you can find the
schematics we'd probably have to do this on a best effort basis.

> 4. Doesn't come out of suspend. No idea what's wrong, how to debug it?

My first step when debugging suspend/resume issues is usually to pass
no_console_suspend on the kernel command-line. That's really only useful
for debugging consoles and it probably doesn't work well if you've only
got the framebuffer console.

Other than that it might be possible to try and validate suspend/resume
on a more "accessible" device (such as a Jetson TK1), fix any issues
that might have and hope that also fixes Nyan.

You may also want to play around with different suspend modes. Suspend
to memory is usually easier to make work. Anything else might require
assistance from the bootloader/firmware side (there's often a warmboot
binary that needs to be executed when resuming from lower, or I guess
higher depending on how you look at it, suspend modes).

Is this really the power going away and coming back up? In that case it
might be a regulator that's being temporarily disabled during boot and
then brought back up. It could also be a USB reset, which I think is
something that's absolutely necessary in order for the kernel to be able
to properly enumerate the devices.

If it's a regulator it might be possible to mark it as always-on.

What exactly are the side-effects of the power-cycle? Does it cause the
USB device not to work at all, or does it stall the boot, or perhaps
even break it (I assume not since you mentioned you can get to a login
prompt).

Let me know if you make any progress, or have any questions that I can
help with. I have limited options since most of the devices from that
era that I used to have access to have stopped working (or accumulated
lots of dust at this point), but I'm happy to help if I can.

Thierry
