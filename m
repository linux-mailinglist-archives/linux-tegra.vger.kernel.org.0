An ugly hack isn't necessary, though some improvements to the part_efi
detection are required.
part_test_efi() only tests if a valid legacy MBR exists, which is not
the best way to validate the existence of a GPT.
For instance, it is possible to have a pure GPT without a MBR.
Or if the MBR is ever corrupted, but the GPT is still valid, the
device wouldn't be bootable.
I found by bypassing the test, the rest of the efi_part code properly
detects the GPT partitions from the backup table.

I have found a few other issues along the way with the Tegra30 code.
The clk dump command returns nothing.
USB appears to be completely broken.
The gadget mode driver only works with the first USB controller on the
Tegra30, but it is trying to attach to the third controller.
If the first controller is the only one available, it simply fails
with "enodev".
The other controllers detect their devices only about half the time.
When they do detect a device, either they fail to configure it or get
constant timeouts when attempting to communicate with it:
