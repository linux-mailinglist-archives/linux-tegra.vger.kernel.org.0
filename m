I want jobs to be a self-contained. Instead of pushing commands to the
PB of a kernel driver, we'll push them to job's cmdstream. This means
that for each new job we'll need to allocate a host1x buffer.

Yes, and with drm-sched we will just need to limit the max number of
jobs in the h/w queue (i.e. push buffer) and then push buffer won't ever
overflow. Problem solved.

My solution doesn't require changes to firewall, not sure whether it's
easier.

I won't be able to test UAPI fully until all features are at least on
par with the experimental driver of grate kernel.
