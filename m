Any suggestions on how to do that? Do you just want to rename the
problematic nodes? Or do you want to introduce a standard naming scheme?
As an example, I was running into the issue with this node:

	pinmux@70000014 {
		pinctrl-names =3D "default";
		pinctrl-0 =3D <&state_default>;

		state_default: pinmux {
			...

			pwm-a-b {
				nvidia,pins =3D "sdc";
				nvidia,function =3D "pwm";
				nvidia,tristate =3D <TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE>;
			};

			...
		};
	};

My first instinct was to just add some sort of prefix to this, but then
I realized that might not be the best option because there could be
countless other nodes whose names might start with "pwm-" but that had
nothing to do with PWM controllers whatsoever.

You could for example have some node named "pwm-fan" and then these
standard bindings will require that to be have a #pwm-cells property.

So I think the solution of only explicitly "activating" PWM controller
bindings would work well in this particular case because it would only
apply the bindings where explicitly requested. That way it doesn't
matter what nodes are named.

There are two easy solutions to this: 1) convert all PWM bindings to
YAML so that they have an explicit schema or 2) consider the presence of
the #pwm-cells property as a marker that the node represents a PWM
controller/provider, irrespective of the name. The latter would be much
like gpio-controller or interrupt-controller, though less redundant.

We could even go as far as using #pwm-cells as the definitive marker and
then require that it has a certain name, like we do for other types of
nodes. I did a quick audit and came up with the following results. These
are all the PWM controller nodes that I could find that don't follow the
"^pwm(@.*)?$" pattern. The files are only one example of where I found
them and there were often others that used the same pattern.

 - arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-gru-chromebook.dtsi
     - ec-pwm

       It should be trivial to rename these to just "pwm" since I don't
       see the cros-ec driver relying on the exact name.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/am5729-beagleboneai.dts
     - stmpe_pwm

       The stmpe MFD driver actually relies on this name, so not sure if
       there's a lot we can do about that.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-38x.dtsi
     - gpio@...

       This is both a GPIO and PWM controller, so can't really do much
       about the name.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/at91-kizbox.dts
     - pwm

       Actually also matches the pattern because the '@.*' part is
       optional.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/at91sam9n12.dtsi
     - hlcdc-pwm

       The MFD driver matches on the compatible string, so we should be
       able to just rename this to "pwm".

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/da850.dtsi
    - ecap@...

      No matching on the name as far as I can tell, so we should be able
      to rename this 'pwm@...'.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/logicpd-torpedo-baseboard.dtsi
    - dmtimer-pwm

      Could probably be renamed 'pwm'.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/lpc32xx.dtsi
    - mpwm@...

      Could probably be renamed 'pwm'.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/motorola-mapphone-common.dtsi
    - dmtimer-pwm-*

      Maybe these should be renamed 'pwm@*' instead?

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/s3c24xx.dtsi
    - timer@...

      This is a variant similar to dmtimer-pwm above and is driven by a
      timer that can run in PWM mode. I think this is the same category
      as the GPIO/PWM controller hybrid above.

      Not much we can do about the name.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/stm32f429.dtsi
    - pwm

      Matches the pattern.

 - arch/arm/boot/dts/twl4030.dtsi
    - pwm

      Matches the pattern.

    - pwmled

      Perhaps both of the above should be named 'pwm@*'? There doesn't
      seem to be any matching on the name.

For many of the above it should be possible to rename them. But then we
will always have exceptions where we can't do that because then it might
conflict with other bindings.

Two interesting things I gathered from the above are that:

  1) nothing in the above actually matches the pwm-* variant that's part
     of the current pattern defined in pwm.yaml and which is causing the
     problem for the pinmux nodes, so an easy solution would be to
     simply drop that part of the pattern since it is useless anyway.

  2) There are actually quite a few PWM controllers that currently are
     not checked because of the name matching. Now I haven't actually
     checked the reverse, i.e. to see if all nodes matching the pattern
     actually have a #pwm-cells property, but given that we miss a
     number of controller because they don't match the pattern makes me
     think that that aspect isn't actually very helpful.

All of the above makes me think even more that we should just abandon
the idea of matching on the names for PWM controller because in some
instances we can't change the name for backwards-compatibility or
because the names would then conflict with other bindings.
