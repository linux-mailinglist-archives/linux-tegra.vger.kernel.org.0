There are races and such that you may never hit during casual testing.

Not true at all.

The PM core has always taken PM-runtime references on all devices pretty much
since when PM-runtime was introduced.

The general problem is that if any device has been touched by system-wide
suspend code, it should not be subject to PM-runtime any more until the
subsequent system-wide resume is able to undo whatever the suspend did.

Moreover, if a device is runtime-suspended, the system-wide suspend code
may mishandle it, in general.  That's why PM-runtime suspend is not allowed
during system-wide transitions at all.  And it has always been like that.

For a specific platform you may be able to overcome these limitations if
you are careful enough, but certainly they are there in general and surely
you cannot prevent people from using your opt-in just because they think
that they know what they are doing.

First of all, ensure that the dpm_list ordering is what it should be on the
system/platform in question.  That can be done with the help of device links.

In addition, make sure that the devices needed to suspend other devices are
suspended in the noirq phase of system-wide suspend and resumed in the
noirq phase of system-wide resume.  Or at least all of the other devices
need to be suspended before them and resumed after them.

These two things should allow you to cover the vast majority of cases if
not all of them without messing up with the rules.

Thanks!
