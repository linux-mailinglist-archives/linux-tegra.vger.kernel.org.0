Because it was accidentally added in patch 7. This is leftover from an
earlier set of patches.

I'm primarily targetting Tegra186 and Tegra194 with these patches
because we need the interconnects properties on those platforms in order
to correctly set the DMA masks at a global scope. For Tegra186 and
Tegra194 I can only see a single memory client for host1x.

Looking at the register documentation, the host1xw and host1xr clients
do exist on Tegra210 and earlier and they are used for indirect writes
and reads, respectively.

I don't think we use indirect reads/writes, so we can probably do
without the corresponding memory clients. Alternatively we could
conditionally add them on Tegra210 and earlier.

I started adding this after finishing Tegra186 and Tegra194, but then I
ran into various other issues and wanted to do this step by step, so I
plan to go back to Tegra210 and earlier later on and stub them out.

However, since I had already done the research I wanted to leave these
in here for later reference, so I didn't have to go back and look this
up again.

I only noticed after posting this series that you had sent out the
series for interconnects and that it conflicted in the bindings.

But yeah, I do also like the contextual names better because they are
more intuitive.

There's quite a bit to review here, but I also have a couple of patches
that depend on these, so yeah, it'd be great if this could go in sooner
rather than later.
