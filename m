Hi Viresh,

Sorry for the late reply.

- I think we don't need separate CPU clock driver & to reuse

 =C2=A0 cpufreq-dt driver as we will still have to replicate same logic

 =C2=A0 from cpufreq driver to that dummy clock driver for calculating

 =C2=A0 actual cpufreq from MSR value. So, it won't add much value.

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - "qcom-cpufreq-hw.c" is using clk_get_rate() during in=
it, but

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 the frequency ops "get/target_index" write =
to register directly

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 and not using clk api's. Also, the clock dr=
iver from gcc-msm*.c

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 seem to handle all clocks in CCPLEX.

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Tegra SOC's which didn't have BPMP had the =
clock handling

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 done by CCPLEX. They were using clk_{get|se=
t}_rate() api's

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 as you mentioned. But in Tegra194, all cloc=
k handling is done

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 within BPMP R5 core except CPU clock(which =
is through MSR).

- Adding OPP's with dev_pm_opp_add() is also not required as:

 =C2=A0=C2=A0 1) We don't have any consumer like energy model or EAS in

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Tegra194 which it seems was valid wit=
h "qcom-cpufreq-hw.c".

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 So, i think it won't be useful for T1=
94.

 =C2=A0=C2=A0 2) Also, there is no way to map ndiv to voltage in kernel. Ke=
rnel

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 driver passes ndiv value to BPMP(R5) =
which converts to vhint.

Please share your inputs.
