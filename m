Yes, I agree. Both solutions have their pros and cons. However, I don't
think they can co-exist sanely.

Ah interesting, thanks for the pointer.

What I'm worried about is the consistency with cpufreq.

Probably cpufreq_update_limits() should be called from the interrupt
handler.

Actually the stats are for software mitigation. For the driver, create a
debugfs entry like what do the other drivers or a module parameter with
the stats.

That is a good question. IMO, first step would be to call
cpufreq_update_limits().

[ Cc Thara who implemented the thermal pressure ]

May be Thara has an idea about how to aggregate both? There is another
series floating around with hardware limiter [1] and the same problematic.
