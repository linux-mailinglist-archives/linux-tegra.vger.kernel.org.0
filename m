Of course you are right that it's a mistake. I am just pondering if
over how bad the mistake(s) really are and what we can do about them.

For example, on x86, the ACPI PM domain is used to power the SDIO card
and the SDIO func device (the SDIO card is the parent to the SDIO func
device) via runtime PM.

Honestly, I don't know how to fix this, unless we allow the drivers to
call the ACPI power on/off functions directly, but that doesn't sound
very nice either and kind of defeats the purpose of using the PM
domain.

That wouldn't help in the SDIO case as the power on/off thingy is
still relying on those runtime PM calls.

Kind regards
