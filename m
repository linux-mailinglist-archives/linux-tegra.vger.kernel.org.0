Maybe add the following here? :

Calling the device's close() method on inhibit (if there are users) allows the driver
to save power. Either by directly powering down the device or by releasing the
runtime-pm reference it got in open() when the driver is using runtime-pm.

Otherwise this looks good to me. Thank you for doing this, we (including myself)
really need to get better at doucmenting all sorts of kernel things. Often we have
these long discussions about something on the mailinglist and then everyone is
expected to just know what was decided from the on, which really doesn't work all
that well.
