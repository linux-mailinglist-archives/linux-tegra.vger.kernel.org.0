-* Synopsys DWC Ethernet QoS IP version 4.10 driver (GMAC)
-
-This binding is deprecated, but it continues to be supported, but new
-features should be preferably added to the stmmac binding document.
-
-This binding supports the Synopsys Designware Ethernet QoS (Quality Of Service)
-IP block. The IP supports multiple options for bus type, clocking and reset
-structure, and feature list. Consequently, a number of properties and list
-entries in properties are marked as optional, or only required in specific HW
-configurations.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: One of:
-  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
-    Represents the IP core when integrated into the Axis ARTPEC-6 SoC.
-  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
-    Represents the IP core when integrated into the NVIDIA Tegra186 SoC.
-  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
-    This combination is deprecated. It should be treated as equivalent to
-    "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10". It is supported to be
-    compatible with earlier revisions of this binding.
-- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
-- clocks: Phandle and clock specifiers for each entry in clock-names, in the
-  same order. See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt.
-- clock-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
-  configuration, in any order:
-  - "tx"
-    The EQOS transmit path clock. The HW signal name is clk_tx_i.
-    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock also drives the PHY TX
-    path. In other configurations, other clocks (such as tx_125, rmii) may
-    drive the PHY TX path.
-  - "rx"
-    The EQOS receive path clock. The HW signal name is clk_rx_i.
-    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock is derived from the
-    PHY's RX clock output. In other configurations, other clocks (such as
-    rx_125, rmii) may drive the EQOS RX path.
-    In cases where the PHY clock is directly fed into the EQOS receive path
-    without intervening logic, the DT need not represent this clock, since it
-    is assumed to be fully under the control of the PHY device/driver. In
-    cases where SoC integration adds additional logic to this path, such as a
-    SW-controlled clock gate, this clock should be represented in DT.
-  - "slave_bus"
-    The CPU/slave-bus (CSR) interface clock. This applies to any bus type;
-    APB, AHB, AXI, etc. The HW signal name is hclk_i (AHB) or clk_csr_i (other
-    buses).
-  - "master_bus"
-    The master bus interface clock. Only required in configurations that use a
-    separate clock for the master and slave bus interfaces. The HW signal name
-    is hclk_i (AHB) or aclk_i (AXI).
-  - "ptp_ref"
-    The PTP reference clock. The HW signal name is clk_ptp_ref_i.
-  - "phy_ref_clk"
-    This clock is deprecated and should not be used by new compatible values.
-    It is equivalent to "tx".
-  - "apb_pclk"
-    This clock is deprecated and should not be used by new compatible values.
-    It is equivalent to "slave_bus".
-
-  Note: Support for additional IP configurations may require adding the
-  following clocks to this list in the future: clk_rx_125_i, clk_tx_125_i,
-  clk_pmarx_0_i, clk_pmarx1_i, clk_rmii_i, clk_revmii_rx_i, clk_revmii_tx_i.
-  Configurations exist where multiple similar clocks are used at once, e.g. all
-  of clk_rx_125_i, clk_pmarx_0_i, clk_pmarx1_i. For this reason it is best to
-  extend the binding with a separate clock-names entry for each of those RX
-  clocks, rather than repurposing the existing "rx" clock-names entry as a
-  generic/logical clock in a similar fashion to "master_bus" and "slave_bus".
-  This will allow easy support for configurations that support multiple PHY
-  interfaces using a mux, and hence need to have explicit control over
-  specific RX clocks.
-
-  The following compatible values require the following set of clocks:
-  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
-    - "slave_bus"
-    - "master_bus"
-    - "rx"
-    - "tx"
-    - "ptp_ref"
-  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
-    - "slave_bus"
-    - "master_bus"
-    - "tx"
-    - "ptp_ref"
-  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10" (deprecated):
-    - "phy_ref_clk"
-    - "apb_clk"
-- interrupts: Should contain the core's combined interrupt signal
-- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
-- resets: Phandle and reset specifiers for each entry in reset-names, in the
-  same order. See ../reset/reset.txt.
-- reset-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
-  configuration, in any order:
-  - "eqos". The reset to the entire module. The HW signal name is hreset_n
-    (AHB) or aresetn_i (AXI).
-
-  The following compatible values require the following set of resets:
-  (the reset properties may be omitted if empty)
-  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
-    - "eqos".
-  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
-    - None.
-  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10" (deprecated):
-    - None.
-
-Optional properties:
-- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent
-- phy-reset-gpios: Phandle and specifier for any GPIO used to reset the PHY.
-  See ../gpio/gpio.txt.
-- snps,en-lpi: If present it enables use of the AXI low-power interface
-- snps,write-requests: Number of write requests that the AXI port can issue.
-  It depends on the SoC configuration.
-- snps,read-requests: Number of read requests that the AXI port can issue.
-  It depends on the SoC configuration.
-- snps,burst-map: Bitmap of allowed AXI burst lengts, with the LSB
-  representing 4, then 8 etc.
-- snps,txpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the TX DMA
-- snps,rxpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the RX DMA
-- snps,en-tx-lpi-clockgating: Enable gating of the MAC TX clock during
-  TX low-power mode.
-- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
-- mdio device tree subnode: When the GMAC has a phy connected to its local
-    mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
-    required properties:
-    - compatible: Must be "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-mdio".
-    - #address-cells: Must be <1>.
-    - #size-cells: Must be <0>.
-
-    For each phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
-    fields:
-
-    - reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
-    - device_type: Must be "ethernet-phy".
-    - fixed-mode device tree subnode: see fixed-link.txt in the same directory
-
-The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
-defined in ethernet.txt.

+            - description: The CPU/slave-bus (CSR) interface clock. This
+                applies to any bus type; APB, AHB, AXI, etc. The HW signal
+                name is hclk_i (AHB) or clk_csr_i (other buses).
+
+            - description: The EQOS receive path clock. The HW signal name is
+                clk_rx_i. In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock
+                is derived from the PHY's RX clock output. In other
+                configurations, other clocks (such as rx_125, rmii) may drive
+                the EQOS RX path. In cases where the PHY clock is directly fed
+                into the EQOS receive path without intervening logic, the DT
+                need not represent this clock, since it is assumed to be fully
+                under the control of the PHY device or driver. In cases where
+                SoC integration adds additional logic to this path, such as a
+                SW-controlled clock gate, this clock should be represented in
+                DT.
+
+            - description: The EQOS transmit path clock. The HW signal name is
+                clk_tx_i. In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock
+                also drives the PHY TX path. In other configurations, other
+                clocks (such as tx_125, rmii) may drive the PHY TX path.
