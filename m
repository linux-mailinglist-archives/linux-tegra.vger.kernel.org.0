Please use my version of the patch that was well tested.

I was commenting on that old patchset and was aware about that old
patch, it's unrelated here.

What you're saying here, is that you don't look at the patches on the
ML. This is exactly what happened more than one time in the past when
patches missed merge window and a large part of work was held back by
another two months.  This happened not only to me, but also to other
people, it's bad to see when you're about to do it again.

It's impossible to communicate when you're not looking at the messages
or not replying.  I don't know where the problem is.  If you're too busy
and don't have enough time for maintaining upstream, then solution could
be to share the duties with more people.
