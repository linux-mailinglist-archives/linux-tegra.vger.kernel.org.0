I just recalled that Mikko didn't like *not* to have the per-channel
contexts, saying that it should be good to have for later SoCs.

We could have a DRM context and channel contexts within the DRM context.
Then the mapping will need to be done to the channel contexts of the DRM
context, this should allow us to retain the per-channel contexts and
have a single mapping for older userspace.
