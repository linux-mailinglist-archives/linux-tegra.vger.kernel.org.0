clk_disable_unprepare in aosc_utils_set_rate will not disable PLLA as it=20
will be in use by other consumer (I2S).

But clock driver it self takes care of disabling pll output and keeping=20
it in bypass state so its not really like PLLA output is off.

So regarding PLLA rate change, we dont have to explicitly disable in=20
audio driver as pll clock driver takes care during rate update,

But consumer clocks of PLLA need to be disabled during rate update so=20
existing dividers doesn't cause any malfunction with new rate update.

audio mclk can will be in disabled state during rate update thru=20
hw_params with addition of shutdown snd_soc_ops callbacks to disable of=20
audio mclk.

But issue is for I2S clock where clock might be in enabled state and=20
this is issue with current I2S driver already.

Sameer/Dmitry,

Making sure I2S clock is in disabled state during rate update is=20
something need to work thru for proper fix and this is not related to=20
this patch series as this issue exists with current upstream.

So, can we take care of this as separate patch out of this series so I=20
can get this series out as this PMC clock changes are needed for=20
upcoming camera drivers.
