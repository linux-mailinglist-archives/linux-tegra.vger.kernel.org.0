I don't know what you means by "built around the proprietary firmware".
Yes, this ends up using proprietary firmware for some of the hardware
engines that host1x drives, but that's completely orthogonal to the
UABI. No matter what UABI we'd be introducing, we'd be using that same
firmware.

And yes, this is based on the UABI of the downstream drivers. The design
is guided by what we've learned over the last decade working with this
hardware in use-cases that customers need. It'd be dumb not to use that
knowledge to our advantage. This is the only way to ensure we can
deliver an upstream driver that's on par with our downstream drivers and
therefore make it possible to eventually adopt the upstream driver.

And frankly, you did get answers to previous questions, though perhaps
not all, but I'm out of patience. We've been going in circles and at
some point we have to make a decision so we can make progress.

I made several attempts over the years to get something usable merged
upstream so that we can finally make use of this hardware and get it
supported upstream and each time I made the mistake of trying to make it
perfect and accomodate all wishlist items. The result is that I wasted a
lot of time and have nothing to show for it.

I've also been very hard Mikko with his work on this and I think we've
stretched this as far as we can without compromising too much on what we
are going to need from this UABI in the future.

We've gone through the process of making sure all existing userspace can
and does work with this new UABI and even left the old UABI in place in
case we need it.

I'm reasonably satisfied with what we have now and I don't see any
reason to hold this back any further. We always have the option of
adding UABI if we need it for something, or extend functionality of
existing UABI where it makes sense. But we also do have to start
somewhere, otherwise we're just not going to get anywhere, as the last
10 years have shown.

We've been over this multiple times before, though perhaps never over
email. So let me make this clear here again and for future reference: we
will *not* be rewriting the driver from scratch.

If there are any serious performance and stability issues, then we'll
find them and address them incrementally, like we always do in the
kernel.
