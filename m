My comment was about statistics, they would be inconsistent after your
change. E.g. currently, totalcma_pages is equal to the sum of CMA
pages in each zone. But that would no longer be true, and applications
/ administrators looking at those statistics might see the
inconsistency (between meminfo and vmstat) and wonder what's going on.
It seems best to keep those numbers in sync.

In general, I think it's fine to support dynamic allocation, and I
agree with your arguments that it doesn't seem right to set the number
of CMA areas via a config option. I would just like there to be a
canonical way to find all CMA areas.
