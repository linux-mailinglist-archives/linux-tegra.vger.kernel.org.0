Yeah; I should have changed that 'dynamically' part of the text above
a bit. However, as I commented in the text below, in the case that more
CS IDs are needed (let's wait for the maintainers to comment on this...)
in the future, this change makes the code more maintainable, as for
the allocation part, the developer would only have to update the CS_N
macro to the number of CS IDs that are needed.

Thanks
