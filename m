I guess my underlying question is whether new drivers should ever use
->swizzle_irq() and ->map_irq().  I'm hoping the answer is "no".

If we need them for pre-DT systems or things with incomplete DTs in
the field, I guess we have to live with that.

All ACPI really gives you is the _PRT, and I'm not sure that's
expressive enough to describe platforms that need these things, so
maybe this will eventually solve itself.
