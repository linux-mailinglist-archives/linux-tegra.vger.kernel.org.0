Of course I meant a "later version of this series" :) Sorry for not

Not having a complete control over sync points state is a radical
change, IMO. I prefer not to use this legacy and error-prone way of sync
points handling at least for older h/w where it's possible to do. This
is what downstream driver did 10 years ago and what it still continues
to do. I was very happy to move away from this unnecessary complication
in the experimental grate-kernel driver and I think this will be great
to do in the mainline as well.

The need to map buffers explicitly is also a big difference. The need to
map BO for each channel is a quite big over-complication as we already
found out in the current version of UAPI.

Alright, perhaps the mapping could improved for older userspace if we
will move away from a per-channel contexts to a single DRM context like
I already was suggesting to Mikko before. I.e. instead of mapping BO "to
a channel", we will need to map BO "to h/w clients" within the DRM
context. This should allow older userspace to create a single mapping
for all channels/clients using a single IOCTL and then to have a single
"mapping handle" to care about. Objections?
