I think that's a fair point. I don't see why we can't support both
implicit and explicit syncpoint requests. If most of the use-cases can
work with implicit syncpoints and let the kernel handle all aspects of
it, that's great. But there's no reason we can't provide more explicit
controls for cases where it's really important that all the resources
are allocated upfront.

Ultimately this is very specific to each use-case, so I think having
both options will provide us with the most flexibility.
