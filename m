All the messages from me and David are in yours email inbox and on
#tegra IRC. You have the complete visibility. Either you don't have time
to take a look and then forget about it or I don't know what's the problem.

My point is that you're ignoring the existing patches. It may not look
like a big problem to you since you can apply patches directly and I
understand that own patches are always the most important ones, but this
is a problem for everyone around you.
