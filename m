Yes, this is not really well-thought yet. Although I guess it should be
fine to assume that all the relevant hardware units are blocked by the
CLK framework that disables the orphaned clocks (by default).

Probably we'll have to better define what drivers are system-critical
for the platform, making sure that they are always included in the
kernel build and complied as built-in. But I also guess there could be
other (better) variants as well.

For now I'm primarily focused on getting the CPU voltage scaling to
work. The CORE minimum voltage is kept limited for now to the
boot-level. I'm assuming that the boot-stage voltages are at reasonable
levels for all boards because otherwise likely that there is a trouble
already (constraint violations).

I described the coupling voltage constraints in the replies to the
relevant patches.

The CORE regulator supplies multiple peripherals in the SoC, each
peripheral has it's own demand for a minimum CORE voltage depending on a
clock rate and hardware version.

Tegra20 has the RTC (real-time-clock domain) regulator being coupled in
addition to the CORE. It doesn't supply any peripherals in the SoC that
have specific demands for minimum RTC voltage.

Please let me know if there is a need to explain anything else in a more
detail.
