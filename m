And this is true regardless of whether the PCI tegra controller is
*the* actual controller in the system, aka as long as the Tegra driver
is compiled in, relaxed ordering is forced for any PCIe device.

This is gross and I do believe the fix should be propagated back to
the commit that introduced it, it should have never been implemented
like this.

More or less, I will tweak it myself. Regardless the way it is
handled at the moment is really really not acceptable, one more
reason why this patch should be backported IMO.
