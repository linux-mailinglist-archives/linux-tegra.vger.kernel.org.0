I've looked at the documentation in a bit more details and here's an
high-level overview of what SOCTHERM is.

We have four groups (CPU, GPU, MEM and PLLX), each of which can be
programmed at four different levels (each level is an identical set of
registers to program temperature thresholds, throttling and enable or
disable). For temperature thresholds an interrupt can be configured.

There's an additional "thermtrip" level, which only has a threshold
that, when reached, will cause an emergency, hardware-induced shutdown
of the system.

Any of the generic levels can be used in whatever way we want. The
convention currently is to program the thermal zone trip points using
level 0. So for each group we create a thermal zone and level 0 for each
of the zones is programmed with the low and high thresholds for a given
trip point.

Currently we also use levels 1 and 2 to program the "light" and "heavy"
throttling "indicators". These will in turn be used to generate outputs
to the actual throttling mechanisms (CPU-light, CPU-heavy, GPU-light and
GPU-heavy).

There are a few other things that can be done, but I don't fully
understand how they would be useful and I don't think they've ever been
used, so I'll skip those for now.

Given the above, the thermal zone trip points are fairly clear. They are
fine as they are implemented. For the throttling mechanism we could do
something that maps more explicitly to the above groups and levels
concepts, but I think that could easily conflict with the trip points
programming, so keeping with the current conventions seems good and
designing the device tree bindings accordingly would help avoid any
conflicts.

So I think keeping the throttle-cfgs node is a good fit. We don't really
need to establish a connection between the thermal zone and the throttle
mechanism, though. We can derive the level from the indicator (light or
heavy) and for the group we only need an ID. The reason why I proposed a
link to the thermal-zone is because that thermal zone contains that ID
already, but we could equally well just add an nvidia,group property or
something along those lines so we know which group to use rather than
try and get it from a thermal zone.

I'll revise the bindings to see if I can come up with something.

Thierry
