Per the conversation on the p3450 mts bug workaround patch [0], the
conclusion was reached that the regression test setup does not pass
the emc tables to a mainline kernel. And as I described earlier in
that thread, neither will a normal L4T install. Which means the
tegra210-emc driver will always fail to probe unless the device is
flashed in the way I do for Android. If there's another way to get
that reserved ram node passed to a mainline kernel, I am unaware of
it.

This isn't about upstream or downstream device trees, it's about what
the bootloader sets to the in-ram dt during boot, namely for this
case: the emc tables reserved ram node. Which is currently supported
by tegra210-emc.
