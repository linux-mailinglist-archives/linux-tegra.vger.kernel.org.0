Sure, I will send those changes once this fundamental patchset will be merged.

This is not sufficient for Tegra because we have individual OPP tables for the root PLLs, system clocks and device clocks. The device clocks could be muxed to a different PLLs, depending on clk requirements of a particular board.

>> Please see the example lockdep trace in the end of the email that is fixed by the mutex annotation. What we have there is the tegra-host1x device driver that resumes PMC powergate domain on Tegra30, the PMC driver enables clock from the genpd.power_on callback of the powergate domain and this propagates to the clock's RPM callback which sets the performance vote of the core domain. Hence core domain vote is set from within of the powergate domain.

The locking was a concern, but turned out that it works nicely for the Tegra clk/power tree. This approach may not be suitable for other SoCs.

The device drivers don't manage the parent clocks directly and OPP core doesn't support this use-case where OPP needs to be applied to a generic/parent PLL clock. Moving the OPP management to the clk driver is the easy solution which works good in practice for Tegra, it also removes a need to switch each driver to dev_pm_opp_set_rate() usage.

https://github.com/grate-driver/linux/tree/master has all the latest versions of patches applied.

For example please see clock@60006000 and pmc@7000e400 nodes of [1].
